- generate branches for all packages, give them their own timeline
    - generate a `snowball/package.nix` using the position and attribute info
    - generate a `snowball/snowball.nix` that looks like a flake, and defaults to outputting the package
    - generate a `snowball/options.nix` that contains named inputs (variants), for generating various flake-lock outputs (defaults to a linux and darwin variant)
    - generate a `snowball/metadata/` the location for all the `[variant.json]` files
- have the search results
    - buttons for:
        - install to system
        - install to project
        - use inside a nix file (hover/click=>copy-paste)
    - have all those^ link to the branches instead of nixpkgs directly
