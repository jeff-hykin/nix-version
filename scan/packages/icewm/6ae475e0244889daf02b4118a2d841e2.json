{"frozen":{"name":"icewm","shortDescription":"A simple, lightweight X window manager","longDescription":"IceWM is a window manager for the X Window System. The goal of IceWM is\nspeed, simplicity, and not getting in the userâ€™s way. It comes with a\ntaskbar with pager, global and per-window keybindings and a dynamic menu\nsystem. Application windows can be managed by keyboard and mouse. Windows\ncan be iconified to the taskbar, to the tray, to the desktop or be made\nhidden. They are controllable by a quick switch window (Alt+Tab) and in a\nwindow list. A handful of configurable focus models are\nmenu-selectable. Setups with multiple monitors are supported by RandR and\nXinerama. IceWM is very configurable, themeable and well documented. It\nincludes an optional external background wallpaper manager with\ntransparency support, a simple session manager and a system tray.\n","versionString":"2.1.2","homepage":"https://www.ice-wm.org/","license":{"deprecated":true,"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,1,2]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["icewm"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/window-managers/icewm/default.nix:93","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
