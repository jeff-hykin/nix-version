{"frozen":{"name":"icewm","shortDescription":"A simple, lightweight X window manager","longDescription":"IceWM is a window manager for the X Window System. The goal of IceWM is\nspeed, simplicity, and not getting in the userâ€™s way. It comes with a\ntaskbar with pager, global and per-window keybindings and a dynamic menu\nsystem. Application windows can be managed by keyboard and mouse. Windows\ncan be iconified to the taskbar, to the tray, to the desktop or be made\nhidden. They are controllable by a quick switch window (Alt+Tab) and in a\nwindow list. A handful of configurable focus models are\nmenu-selectable. Setups with multiple monitors are supported by RandR and\nXinerama. IceWM is very configurable, themeable and well documented. It\nincludes an optional external background wallpaper manager with\ntransparency support, a simple session manager and a system tray.\n","versionString":"2.6.0","homepage":"https://www.ice-wm.org/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 only","redistributable":true,"shortName":"lgpl2Only","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,6,0]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["icewm"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/window-managers/icewm/default.nix:112","date":"2021-10-20"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
