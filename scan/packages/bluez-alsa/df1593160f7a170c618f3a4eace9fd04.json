{"frozen":{"name":"bluez-alsa","shortDescription":"Bluez 5 Bluetooth Audio ALSA Backend","longDescription":"Bluez-ALSA (BlueALSA) is an ALSA backend for Bluez 5 audio interface.\nBluez-ALSA registers all Bluetooth devices with audio profiles in Bluez\nunder a virtual ALSA PCM device called `bluealsa` that supports both\nplayback and capture.\n\nSome backstory: Bluez 5 removed built-in support for ALSA in favor of a\ngeneric interface for 3rd party appliations. Thereafter, PulseAudio\nimplemented a backend for that interface and became the only way to get\nBluetooth audio with Bluez 5. Users prefering ALSA stayed on Bluez 4.\nHowever, Bluez 4 eventually became deprecated.\n\nThis package is a rebirth of a direct interface between ALSA and Bluez 5,\nthat, unlike PulseAudio, provides KISS near-metal-like experience. It is\nnot possible to run BluezALSA and PulseAudio Bluetooth at the same time\ndue to limitations in Bluez, but it is possible to run PulseAudio over\nBluezALSA if you disable `bluetooth-discover` and `bluez5-discover`\nmodules in PA and configure it to play/capture sound over `bluealsa` PCM.\n","versionString":"2.1.0","homepage":"https://github.com/Arkq/bluez-alsa","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,1,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["bluez-alsa"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/bluetooth/bluez-alsa/default.nix:42","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
