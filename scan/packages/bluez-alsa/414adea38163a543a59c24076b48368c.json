{"frozen":{"name":"bluez-alsa","shortDescription":"Bluez 5 Bluetooth Audio ALSA Backend","longDescription":"Bluez-ALSA (BlueALSA) is an ALSA backend for Bluez 5 audio interface.\nBluez-ALSA registers all Bluetooth devices with audio profiles in Bluez\nunder a virtual ALSA PCM device called `bluealsa` that supports both\nplayback and capture.\n\nSome backstory: Bluez 5 removed built-in support for ALSA in favor of a\ngeneric interface for 3rd party appliations. Thereafter, PulseAudio\nimplemented a backend for that interface and became the only way to get\nBluetooth audio with Bluez 5. Users prefering ALSA stayed on Bluez 4.\nHowever, Bluez 4 eventually became deprecated.\n\nThis package is a rebirth of a direct interface between ALSA and Bluez 5,\nthat, unlike PulseAudio, provides KISS near-metal-like experience. It is\nnot possible to run BluezALSA and PulseAudio Bluetooth at the same time\ndue to limitations in Bluez, but it is possible to run PulseAudio over\nBluezALSA if you disable `bluetooth-discover` and `bluez5-discover`\nmodules in PA and configure it to play/capture sound over `bluealsa` PCM.\n","versionString":"3.1.0","homepage":"https://github.com/Arkq/bluez-alsa","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"MIT License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,1,0]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["bluez-alsa"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/bluetooth/bluez-alsa/default.nix:42","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["bluez-alsa"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/bluetooth/bluez-alsa/default.nix:42","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
