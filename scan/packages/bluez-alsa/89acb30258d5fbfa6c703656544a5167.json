{"frozen":{"name":"bluez-alsa","shortDescription":"Bluez 5 Bluetooth Audio ALSA Backend","longDescription":"Bluez-ALSA (BlueALSA) is an ALSA backend for Bluez 5 audio interface.\nBluez-ALSA registers all Bluetooth devices with audio profiles in Bluez\nunder a virtual ALSA PCM device called `bluealsa` that supports both\nplayback and capture.\n\nSome backstory: Bluez 5 removed built-in support for ALSA in favor of a\ngeneric interface for 3rd party appliations. Thereafter, PulseAudio\nimplemented a backend for that interface and became the only way to get\nBluetooth audio with Bluez 5. Users prefering ALSA stayed on Bluez 4.\nHowever, Bluez 4 eventually became deprecated.\n\nThis package is a rebirth of a direct interface between ALSA and Bluez 5,\nthat, unlike PulseAudio, provides KISS near-metal-like experience. It is\nnot possible to run BluezALSA and PulseAudio Bluetooth at the same time\ndue to limitations in Bluez, but it is possible to run PulseAudio over\nBluezALSA if you disable `bluetooth-discover` and `bluez5-discover`\nmodules in PA and configure it to play/capture sound over `bluealsa` PCM.\n","versionString":"1.3.1","homepage":"https://github.com/Arkq/bluez-alsa","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,3,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["bluez-alsa"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/bluetooth/bluez-alsa/default.nix:43","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
