{"frozen":{"name":"pari","shortDescription":"Computer algebra system for high-performance number theory computations","longDescription":"PARI/GP is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast\ncomputations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number theory,\nelliptic curves...), but also contains a large number of other useful\nfunctions to compute with mathematical entities such as matrices,\npolynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc., and a lot of\ntranscendental functions. PARI is also available as a C library to allow\nfor faster computations.\n\nOriginally developed by Henri Cohen and his co-workers (Universit√©\nBordeaux I, France), PARI is now under the GPL and maintained by Karim\nBelabas with the help of many volunteer contributors.\n\n- PARI is a C library, allowing fast computations.\n- gp is an easy-to-use interactive shell giving access to the\n   PARI functions.\n- GP is the name of gp's scripting language.\n- gp2c, the GP-to-C compiler, combines the best of both worlds\n   by compiling GP scripts to the C language and transparently loading\n   the resulting functions into gp. (gp2c-compiled scripts will typically\n   run 3 or 4 times faster.) gp2c currently only understands a subset\n    of the GP language.\n","versionString":"2.11.3","homepage":"http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,11,3]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["pari"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/math/pari/default.nix:60","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin"]}}
