{"frozen":{"name":"pari","shortDescription":"Computer algebra system for high-performance number theory computations","longDescription":"PARI/GP is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast\ncomputations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number theory,\nelliptic curves...), but also contains a large number of other useful\nfunctions to compute with mathematical entities such as matrices,\npolynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc., and a lot of\ntranscendental functions. PARI is also available as a C library to allow\nfor faster computations.\n\nOriginally developed by Henri Cohen and his co-workers (Universit√©\nBordeaux I, France), PARI is now under the GPL and maintained by Karim\nBelabas with the help of many volunteer contributors.\n\n- PARI is a C library, allowing fast computations.\n- gp is an easy-to-use interactive shell giving access to the PARI\n  functions.\n- GP is the name of gp's scripting language.\n- gp2c, the GP-to-C compiler, combines the best of both worlds by\n  compiling GP scripts to the C language and transparently loading the\n  resulting functions into gp. (gp2c-compiled scripts will typically run\n  3 or 4 times faster.) gp2c currently only understands a subset of the\n  GP language.\n","versionString":"2.13.1","homepage":"http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,13,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["pari"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/math/pari/default.nix:60","date":"2021-10-20"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin"]}}
