{"frozen":{"name":"pari","shortDescription":"Computer algebra system for high-performance number theory computations","longDescription":"PARI/GP is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast\ncomputations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number theory,\nelliptic curves...), but also contains a large number of other useful\nfunctions to compute with mathematical entities such as matrices,\npolynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc., and a lot of\ntranscendental functions. PARI is also available as a C library to allow\nfor faster computations.\n\nOriginally developed by Henri Cohen and his co-workers (Universit√©\nBordeaux I, France), PARI is now under the GPL and maintained by Karim\nBelabas with the help of many volunteer contributors.\n\n- PARI is a C library, allowing fast computations.\n- gp is an easy-to-use interactive shell giving access to the\n   PARI functions.\n- GP is the name of gp's scripting language.\n- gp2c, the GP-to-C compiler, combines the best of both worlds\n   by compiling GP scripts to the C language and transparently loading\n   the resulting functions into gp. (gp2c-compiled scripts will typically\n   run 3 or 4 times faster.) gp2c currently only understands a subset\n    of the GP language.\n","versionString":"2.11.1","homepage":"http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,11,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["pari"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/math/pari/default.nix:46","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}},{"kernel":{"families":{"darwin":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"darwin"}}}}]}}
