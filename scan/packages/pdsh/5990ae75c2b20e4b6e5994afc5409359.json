{"frozen":{"name":"pdsh","shortDescription":"High-performance, parallel remote shell utility","longDescription":"Pdsh is a high-performance, parallel remote shell utility. It has\nbuilt-in, thread-safe clients for Berkeley and Kerberos V4 rsh and\ncan call SSH externally (though with reduced performance). Pdsh\nuses a \"sliding window\" parallel algorithm to conserve socket\nresources on the initiating node and to allow progress to continue\nwhile timeouts occur on some connections.\n","versionString":"2.29","homepage":"http://code.google.com/p/pdsh/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0"},"versionNumberList":[2,29]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["pdsh"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/networking/pdsh/default.nix:38","date":"2015-08-08"}]}}
