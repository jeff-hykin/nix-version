It has\nbuilt-in, thread-safe clients for Berkeley and Kerberos V4 rsh and\ncan call SSH externally (though with reduced performance). Pdsh\nuses a \"sliding window\" parallel algorithm to conserve socket\nresources on the initiating node and to allow progress to continue\nwhile timeouts occur on some connections.\n","versionString":"2.26","homepage":"http://code.google.com/p/pdsh/","license":"GPLv2","versionNumberList":[2,26]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["pdsh"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","powerpc-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
