{"frozen":{"name":"pdsh","shortDescription":"High-performance, parallel remote shell utility","longDescription":"Pdsh is a high-performance, parallel remote shell utility. It has\nbuilt-in, thread-safe clients for Berkeley and Kerberos V4 rsh and\ncan call SSH externally (though with reduced performance). Pdsh\nuses a \"sliding window\" parallel algorithm to conserve socket\nresources on the initiating node and to allow progress to continue\nwhile timeouts occur on some connections.\n","versionString":"2.34","homepage":"https://github.com/chaos/pdsh","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,34]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["pdsh"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/networking/pdsh/default.nix:30","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
