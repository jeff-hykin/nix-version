{"frozen":{"name":"sway-unwrapped","shortDescription":"An i3-compatible tiling Wayland compositor","longDescription":"Sway is a tiling Wayland compositor and a drop-in replacement for the i3\nwindow manager for X11. It works with your existing i3 configuration and\nsupports most of i3's features, plus a few extras.\nSway allows you to arrange your application windows logically, rather\nthan spatially. Windows are arranged into a grid by default which\nmaximizes the efficiency of your screen and can be quickly manipulated\nusing only the keyboard.\n","versionString":"1.6.1","homepage":"https://swaywm.org","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"MIT License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,6,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["sway-unwrapped"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/window-managers/sway/default.nix:59","date":"2021-10-20"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
