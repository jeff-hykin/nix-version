{"frozen":{"name":"sway-unwrapped","shortDescription":"An i3-compatible tiling Wayland compositor","longDescription":"Sway is a tiling Wayland compositor and a drop-in replacement for the i3\nwindow manager for X11. It works with your existing i3 configuration and\nsupports most of i3's features, plus a few extras.\nSway allows you to arrange your application windows logically, rather\nthan spatially. Windows are arranged into a grid by default which\nmaximizes the efficiency of your screen and can be quickly manipulated\nusing only the keyboard.\n","versionString":"1.5.1","homepage":"https://swaywm.org","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,5,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["sway-unwrapped"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/window-managers/sway/default.nix:44","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
