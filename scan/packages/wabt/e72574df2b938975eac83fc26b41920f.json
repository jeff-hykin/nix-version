{"frozen":{"name":"wabt","shortDescription":"The WebAssembly Binary Toolkit","longDescription":"WABT (pronounced \"wabbit\") is a suite of tools for WebAssembly, including:\n * wat2wasm: translate from WebAssembly text format to the WebAssembly\n   binary format\n * wasm2wat: the inverse of wat2wasm, translate from the binary format\n   back to the text format (also known as a .wat)\n * wasm-objdump: print information about a wasm binary. Similiar to\n   objdump.\n * wasm-interp: decode and run a WebAssembly binary file using a\n   stack-based interpreter\n * wat-desugar: parse .wat text form as supported by the spec interpreter\n   (s-expressions, flat syntax, or mixed) and print \"canonical\" flat\n   format\n * wasm2c: convert a WebAssembly binary file to a C source and header\n","versionString":"1.0.20","homepage":"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt","license":{"fullName":"Apache License 2.0","shortName":"asl20","spdxId":"Apache-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,0,20]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["wabt"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/wabt/default.nix:20","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
