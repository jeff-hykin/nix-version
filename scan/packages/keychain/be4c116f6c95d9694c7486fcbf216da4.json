{"frozen":{"name":"keychain","shortDescription":"Keychain management tool","longDescription":"Keychain helps you to manage SSH and GPG keys in a convenient and secure\nmanner. It acts as a frontend to ssh-agent and ssh-add, but allows you\nto easily have one long running ssh-agent process per system, rather\nthan the norm of one ssh-agent per login session.\n\nThis dramatically reduces the number of times you need to enter your\npassphrase. With keychain, you only need to enter a passphrase once\nevery time your local machine is rebooted. Keychain also makes it easy\nfor remote cron jobs to securely \"hook in\" to a long-running ssh-agent\nprocess, allowing your scripts to take advantage of key-based logins.\n","versionString":"2.8.5","homepage":"https://www.funtoo.org/Keychain","license":{"deprecated":true,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,8,5]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["keychain"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/keychain/default.nix:34","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["keychain"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/keychain/default.nix:40","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin"]}}
