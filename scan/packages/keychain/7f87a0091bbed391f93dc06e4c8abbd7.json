{"frozen":{"name":"keychain","shortDescription":"Keychain management tool","longDescription":"\t\t\tKeychain helps you to manage SSH and GPG keys in a convenient and secure\n\t\t\tmanner. It acts as a frontend to ssh-agent and ssh-add, but allows you\n\t\t\tto easily have one long running ssh-agent process per system, rather\n\t\t\tthan the norm of one ssh-agent per login session.\n\n\t\t\tThis dramatically reduces the number of times you need to enter your\n\t\t\tpassphrase. With keychain, you only need to enter a passphrase once\n\t\t\tevery time your local machine is rebooted. Keychain also makes it easy\n\t\t\tfor remote cron jobs to securely \"hook in\" to a long-running ssh-agent\n\t\t\tprocess, allowing your scripts to take advantage of key-based logins.\n","versionString":"2.8.5","homepage":"https://www.funtoo.org/Keychain","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,8,5]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["keychain"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/keychain/default.nix:33","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin"]}}
