{"frozen":{"name":"keychain","shortDescription":"Keychain management tool","longDescription":"Keychain helps you to manage SSH and GPG keys in a convenient and secure\nmanner. It acts as a frontend to ssh-agent and ssh-add, but allows you\nto easily have one long running ssh-agent process per system, rather\nthan the norm of one ssh-agent per login session.\n\nThis dramatically reduces the number of times you need to enter your\npassphrase. With keychain, you only need to enter a passphrase once\nevery time your local machine is rebooted. Keychain also makes it easy\nfor remote cron jobs to securely \"hook in\" to a long-running ssh-agent\nprocess, allowing your scripts to take advantage of key-based logins.\n","versionString":"2.8.5","homepage":"https://www.funtoo.org/Keychain","license":{"deprecated":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,8,5]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["keychain"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/keychain/default.nix:33","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin"]}}
