{"frozen":{"name":"python3.4-pycosat","shortDescription":"Python bindings for PicoSAT","longDescription":"PicoSAT is a popular SAT solver written by Armin\n          Biere in pure C. This package provides efficient Python bindings\n          to picosat on the C level, i.e. when importing pycosat, the\n          picosat solver becomes part of the Python process itself. For\n          ease of deployment, the picosat source (namely picosat.c and\n          picosat.h) is included in this project.","versionString":"0.6.0","homepage":"https://github.com/ContinuumIO/pycosat","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT"},"versionNumberList":[0,6,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["python34Packages","pycosat"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/top-level/python-packages.nix:9938","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin"]}}
