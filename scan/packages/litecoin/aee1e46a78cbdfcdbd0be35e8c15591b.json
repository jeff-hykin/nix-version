It is based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs\nfrom Bitcoin in that it can be efficiently mined with consumer-grade hardware.\nLitecoin provides faster transaction confirmations (2.5 minutes on average)\nand uses a memory-hard, scrypt-based mining proof-of-work algorithm to target\nthe regular computers and GPUs most people already have.\nThe Litecoin network is scheduled to produce 84 million currency units.\n","versionString":"0.17.1","homepage":"https://litecoin.org/","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,17,1]},"flexible":{"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["litecoin"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/blockchains/litecoin.nix:39","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
