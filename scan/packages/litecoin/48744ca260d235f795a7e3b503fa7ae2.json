It is based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs\nfrom Bitcoin in that it can be efficiently mined with consumer-grade hardware.\nLitecoin provides faster transaction confirmations (2.5 minutes on average)\nand uses a memory-hard, scrypt-based mining proof-of-work algorithm to target\nthe regular computers and GPUs most people already have.\nThe Litecoin network is scheduled to produce 84 million currency units.\n","versionString":"0.10.2.2","homepage":"https://litecoin.org/","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT"},"versionNumberList":[0,10,2,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["altcoins","litecoin"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/altcoins/litecoin.nix:26","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
