{"frozen":{"name":"bruteforce-luks","shortDescription":"Cracks passwords of LUKS encrypted volumes","longDescription":"The program tries to decrypt at least one of the key slots by trying\nall the possible passwords. It is especially useful if you know\nsomething about the password (i.e. you forgot a part of your password but\nstill remember most of it). Finding the password of a volume without\nknowing anything about it would take way too much time (unless the\npassword is really short and/or weak). It can also use a dictionary.\n","versionString":"1.4.0","homepage":"https://github.com/glv2/bruteforce-luks","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,4,0]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["bruteforce-luks"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/security/bruteforce-luks/default.nix:23","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["bruteforce-luks"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/security/bruteforce-luks/default.nix:23","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
