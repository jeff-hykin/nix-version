{"frozen":{"name":"bruteforce-luks","shortDescription":"Cracks passwords of LUKS encrypted volumes","longDescription":"The program tries to decrypt at least one of the key slots by trying\nall the possible passwords. It is especially useful if you know\nsomething about the password (i.e. you forgot a part of your password but\nstill remember most of it). Finding the password of a volume without\nknowing anything about it would take way too much time (unless the\npassword is really short and/or weak). It can also use a dictionary.\n","versionString":"1.3.1","homepage":"https://github.com/glv2/bruteforce-luks","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,3,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["bruteforce-luks"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/security/bruteforce-luks/default.nix:23","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
