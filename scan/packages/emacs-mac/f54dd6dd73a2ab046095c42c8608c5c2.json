{"frozen":{"name":"emacs-mac","shortDescription":"The extensible, customizable text editor","longDescription":"GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editorâ€”and more.  At its\ncore is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp\nprogramming language with extensions to support text editing.\n\nThe features of GNU Emacs include: content-sensitive editing modes,\nincluding syntax coloring, for a wide variety of file types including\nplain text, source code, and HTML; complete built-in documentation,\nincluding a tutorial for new users; full Unicode support for nearly all\nhuman languages and their scripts; highly customizable, using Emacs\nLisp code or a graphical interface; a large number of extensions that\nadd other functionality, including a project planner, mail and news\nreader, debugger interface, calendar, and more.  Many of these\nextensions are distributed with GNU Emacs; others are available\nseparately.\n\nThis is the \"Mac port\" addition to GNU Emacs 26. This provides a native\nGUI support for Mac OS X 10.6 - 10.12. Note that Emacs 23 and later\nalready contain the official GUI support via the NS (Cocoa) port for\nMac OS X 10.4 and later. So if it is good enough for you, then you\ndon't need to try this.\n","versionString":"27.2-8.3","homepage":"https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[27,2,"-8.3"]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["emacsMacport"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/editors/emacs/macport.nix:95","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin"]}}
