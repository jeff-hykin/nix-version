{"frozen":{"name":"gawk","shortDescription":"GNU implementation of the Awk programming language","longDescription":"Many computer users need to manipulate text files: extract and then\noperate on data from parts of certain lines while discarding the rest,\nmake changes in various text files wherever certain patterns appear,\nand so on.  To write a program to do these things in a language such as\nC or Pascal is a time-consuming inconvenience that may take many lines\nof code.  The job is easy with awk, especially the GNU implementation:\nGawk.\n\nThe awk utility interprets a special-purpose programming language that\nmakes it possible to handle many data-reformatting jobs with just a few\nlines of code.\n","versionString":"4.1.3","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0+"},"versionNumberList":[4,1,3]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["gawk"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/text/gawk/default.nix:30","date":"2015-08-08"}]}}
