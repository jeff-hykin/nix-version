{"frozen":{"name":"gawk","shortDescription":"GNU implementation of the Awk programming language","longDescription":"Many computer users need to manipulate text files: extract and then\noperate on data from parts of certain lines while discarding the rest,\nmake changes in various text files wherever certain patterns appear,\nand so on.  To write a program to do these things in a language such as\nC or Pascal is a time-consuming inconvenience that may take many lines\nof code.  The job is easy with awk, especially the GNU implementation:\nGawk.\n\nThe awk utility interprets a special-purpose programming language that\nmakes it possible to handle many data-reformatting jobs with just a few\nlines of code.\n","versionString":"4.0.2","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/","license":"GPLv3+","versionNumberList":[4,0,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["gawk"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}]}}
