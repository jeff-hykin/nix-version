It was\ndeveloped as part of the NetSurf project and is available for use by other\nsoftware under the MIT licence.\n\nThe HTML5 specification defines a parsing algorithm, based on the\nbehaviour of mainstream browsers, which provides instructions for how to\nparse all markup, both valid and invalid. As a result, Hubbub parses web\ncontent well.\n","versionString":"0.3.7","homepage":"https://www.netsurf-browser.org/projects/hubbub/","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,3,7]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["netsurf","libhubbub"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/networking/browsers/netsurf/libhubbub.nix:29","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
