{"frozen":{"name":"SDL2_gfx","shortDescription":"SDL graphics drawing primitives and support functions","longDescription":"The SDL_gfx library evolved out of the SDL_gfxPrimitives code\nwhich provided basic drawing routines such as lines, circles or\npolygons and SDL_rotozoom which implemented a interpolating\nrotozoomer for SDL surfaces.\n\nThe current components of the SDL_gfx library are:\n\n    * Graphic Primitives (SDL_gfxPrimitves.h)\n    * Rotozoomer (SDL_rotozoom.h)\n    * Framerate control (SDL_framerate.h)\n    * MMX image filters (SDL_imageFilter.h)\n    * Custom Blit functions (SDL_gfxBlitFunc.h)\n\nThe library is backwards compatible to the above mentioned\ncode. Its is written in plain C and can be used in C++ code.\n","versionString":"1.0.4","homepage":"http://www.ferzkopp.net/wordpress/2016/01/02/sdl_gfx-sdl2_gfx/","license":{"fullName":"zlib License","shortName":"zlib","spdxId":"Zlib","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/Zlib.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,0,4]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["SDL2_gfx"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/SDL2_gfx/default.nix:19","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["SDL2_gfx"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/SDL2_gfx/default.nix:19","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
