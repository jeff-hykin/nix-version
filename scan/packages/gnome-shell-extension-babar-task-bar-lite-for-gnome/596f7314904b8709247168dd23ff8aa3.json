{"frozen":{"name":"gnome-shell-extension-babar-task-bar-lite-for-gnome","shortDescription":"Task bar. App grid, favorites, workspaces and tasks in panel. Light extension.","longDescription":"Task bar. App grid, favorites, workspaces and tasks in panel. Light extension.\n\n Replace 'Activities' button by all current workspaces and apps buttons. Switch workspace/app or toggle overview by clicking on these buttons. Drag and drop favorite, task, dash item or app grid item to any workspace (you cannot reorder tasks inside a workspace). Change 'Places' label to an icon. No settings, use BaBar classic for that.\n\n You can use names for workspaces: there are two ways for that. 1) Edit the string array 'org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences.workspace-names' gsettings key (through dconf editor, e.g.). 2) Use official GNOME extension Workspaces Indicator's settings. You don't have to write a long enough list: numbers are displayed if no workspace name is defined.","versionString":"40-2","homepage":"https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4681/babar-task-bar-lite-for-gnome-40/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["gnomeExtensions","babar-task-bar-lite-for-gnome-40"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/desktops/gnome/extensions/buildGnomeExtension.nix:47","date":"2022-01-31"}]}}
