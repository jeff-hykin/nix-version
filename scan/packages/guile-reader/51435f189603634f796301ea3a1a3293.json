Readers supporting various syntax\nvariants can easily be written, possibly by re-using existing\n\"token readers\" of a standard Scheme readers. For example, it\nis used to implement Skribilo's R5RS-derived document syntax.\n","versionString":"0.6.2","homepage":"https://www.nongnu.org/guile-reader/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"lgpl3Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,6,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["guile-reader"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/guile-modules/guile-reader/default.nix:30","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux"]}}
