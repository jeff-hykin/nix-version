{"frozen":{"name":"pharo","shortDescription":"Pharo virtual machine (multiple variants)","longDescription":"Pharo's goal is to deliver a clean, innovative, free open-source\nSmalltalk-inspired environment. By providing a stable and small core\nsystem, excellent dev tools, and maintained releases, Pharo is an\nattractive platform to build and deploy mission critical applications.\n\nThis package provides a front-end for starting the virtual\nmachine. The command 'pharo-vm' automatically detects the type\nof image and executes a suitable virtual machine: CogV3, Spur,\nor Spur64. This makes it easy to open Pharo images because you\ndo not have to worry about which virtual machine variant is\nrequired.\n\nMore about the Cog family of virtual machines:\n  http://www.mirandabanda.org/cogblog/about-cog/\n","versionString":"pharo","homepage":"http://pharo.org","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"MIT License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["pharo"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/development/pharo/wrapper/default.nix:33","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["pharo"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/pharo/wrapper/default.nix:33","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","armv7a-linux","aarch64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
