{"frozen":{"name":"pharo","shortDescription":"Pharo virtual machine (multiple variants)","longDescription":"Pharo's goal is to deliver a clean, innovative, free open-source\nSmalltalk-inspired environment. By providing a stable and small core\nsystem, excellent dev tools, and maintained releases, Pharo is an\nattractive platform to build and deploy mission critical applications.\n\nThis package provides a front-end for starting the virtual\nmachine. The command 'pharo-vm' automatically detects the type\nof image and executes a suitable virtual machine: CogV3, Spur,\nor Spur64. This makes it easy to open Pharo images because you\ndo not have to worry about which virtual machine variant is\nrequired.\n\nMore about the Cog family of virtual machines:\n  http://www.mirandabanda.org/cogblog/about-cog/\n","versionString":"pharo","homepage":"http://pharo.org","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["pharo"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/pharo/wrapper/default.nix:33","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["pharo"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/pharo/wrapper/default.nix:33","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","armv7a-linux","aarch64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux"]}}
