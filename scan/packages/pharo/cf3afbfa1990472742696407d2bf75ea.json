{"frozen":{"name":"pharo","shortDescription":"Pharo virtual machine (multiple variants)","longDescription":"Pharo's goal is to deliver a clean, innovative, free open-source\nSmalltalk-inspired environment. By providing a stable and small core\nsystem, excellent dev tools, and maintained releases, Pharo is an\nattractive platform to build and deploy mission critical applications.\n\nThis package provides a front-end for starting the virtual\nmachine. The command 'pharo-vm' automatically detects the type\nof image and executes a suitable virtual machine: CogV3, Spur,\nor Spur64. This makes it easy to open Pharo images because you\ndo not have to worry about which virtual machine variant is\nrequired.\n\nMore about the Cog family of virtual machines:\n  http://www.mirandabanda.org/cogblog/about-cog/\n","versionString":"pharo","homepage":"http://pharo.org","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["pharo"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/pharo/wrapper/default.nix:33","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","aarch64-linux","powerpc64le-linux"]}}
