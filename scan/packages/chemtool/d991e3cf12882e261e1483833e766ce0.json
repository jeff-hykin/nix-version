{"frozen":{"name":"chemtool","shortDescription":"Draw chemical structures","longDescription":"Chemtool is a program for drawing organic molecules. It runs under the X\nWindow System using the GTK widget set.\n\nMost operations in chemtool can be accomplished using the mouse - the\nfirst (usually the left) button is used to select or place things, the\nmiddle button modifies properties (e.g. reverses the direction of a bond),\nand the right button is used to delete objects.\n\nThe program offers essentially unlimited undo/redo, two text fonts plus\nsymbols, seven colors, drawing at several zoom scales, and square and\nhexagonal backdrop grids for easier alignment.\n","versionString":"1.6.14","homepage":"http://ruby.chemie.uni-freiburg.de/~martin/chemtool/","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,6,14]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["chemtool"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/chemistry/chemtool/default.nix:33","date":"2021-02-24"}]}}
