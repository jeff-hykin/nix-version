When you write a program, you\n        should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make\n        to build and install the program.\n","versionString":"3.82","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/make/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0+"},"versionNumberList":[3,82]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["gnumake3"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/build-managers/gnumake/3.82/default.nix:44","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
