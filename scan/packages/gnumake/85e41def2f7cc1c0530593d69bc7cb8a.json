When you write a program, you\n        should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make\n        to build and install the program.\n","versionString":"3.82","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/make/","license":"GPLv3+","versionNumberList":[3,82]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["gnumake"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","powerpc-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
