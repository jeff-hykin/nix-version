When you write a program, you\n        should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make\n        to build and install the program.\n","versionString":"3.81","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/make/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0+"},"versionNumberList":[3,81]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["gnumake381"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/build-managers/gnumake/3.81/default.nix:29","date":"2015-08-08"}]}}
