When you write a program, you\n        should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make\n        to build and install the program.\n","versionString":"3.81","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/make/","license":"GPLv2+","versionNumberList":[3,81]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["gnumake381"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}]}}
