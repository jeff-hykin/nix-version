{"frozen":{"name":"simple-scan","shortDescription":"Simple scanning utility","longDescription":"A really easy way to scan both documents and photos. You can crop out the\nbad parts of a photo and rotate it if it is the wrong way round. You can\nprint your scans, export them to pdf, or save them in a range of image\nformats. Basically a frontend for SANE - which is the same backend as\nXSANE uses. This means that all existing scanners will work and the\ninterface is well tested.\n","versionString":"40.5","homepage":"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/simple-scan","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[40,5]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["gnome","simple-scan"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/desktops/gnome/core/simple-scan/default.nix:75","date":"2021-10-20"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
