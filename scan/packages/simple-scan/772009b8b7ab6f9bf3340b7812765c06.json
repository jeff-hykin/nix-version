{"frozen":{"name":"simple-scan","shortDescription":"Simple scanning utility","longDescription":"A really easy way to scan both documents and photos. You can crop out the\nbad parts of a photo and rotate it if it is the wrong way round. You can\nprint your scans, export them to pdf, or save them in a range of image\nformats. Basically a frontend for SANE - which is the same backend as\nXSANE uses. This means that all existing scanners will work and the\ninterface is well tested.\n","versionString":"3.38.1","homepage":"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/simple-scan","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,38,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["gnome3","simple-scan"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/desktops/gnome-3/core/simple-scan/default.nix:73","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
