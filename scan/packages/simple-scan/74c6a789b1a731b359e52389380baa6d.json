{"frozen":{"name":"simple-scan","shortDescription":"Simple scanning utility","longDescription":"A really easy way to scan both documents and photos. You can crop out the\nbad parts of a photo and rotate it if it is the wrong way round. You can\nprint your scans, export them to pdf, or save them in a range of image\nformats. Basically a frontend for SANE - which is the same backend as\nXSANE uses. This means that all existing scanners will work and the\ninterface is well tested.\n","versionString":"3.17.4","homepage":"https://launchpad.net/simple-scan","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0+"},"versionNumberList":[3,17,4]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["simple-scan"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/graphics/simple-scan/default.nix:14","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
