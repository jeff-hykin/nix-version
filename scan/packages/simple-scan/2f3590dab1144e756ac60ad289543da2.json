{"frozen":{"name":"simple-scan","shortDescription":"Simple scanning utility","longDescription":"A really easy way to scan both documents and photos. You can crop out the\nbad parts of a photo and rotate it if it is the wrong way round. You can\nprint your scans, export them to pdf, or save them in a range of image\nformats. Basically a frontend for SANE - which is the same backend as\nXSANE uses. This means that all existing scanners will work and the\ninterface is well tested.\n","versionString":"3.30.2","homepage":"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/simple-scan","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,30,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["gnome3","simple-scan"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/desktops/gnome-3/core/simple-scan/default.nix:37","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
