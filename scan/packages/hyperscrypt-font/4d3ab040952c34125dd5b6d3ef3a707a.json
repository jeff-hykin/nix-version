{"frozen":{"name":"hyperscrypt-font","shortDescription":"A modern stencil typeface inspired by stained glass technique","longDescription":"The Hyper Scrypt typeface was designed for the Hyper Chapelle\nexhibition. It was commissioned by AAAAA Atelier to Studio\nTriple's designer Jérémy Landes.  Hyper Scrypt is a modern\nstencil typeface inspired by the stained glass technique used in\nthe Metz cathedral. It borrows the stained glass method, drawing\nholes for the light with black lead. This creates a reverse\ntypeface, where the shapes of the letters are drawn by their\ncounters. Hyper Scrypt is at the intersection between 3 metals :\nthe sacred lead of stained glass, the lead of print characters\nand the heavy metal. Despite its organic look inherited for the\nmolted metal, Hyper Scrypt is based upon a rigorous grid,\nallowing some neat alignements between shapes in multi lines\nlayouts.\n","versionString":"1.1","homepage":"http://velvetyne.fr/fonts/hyper-scrypt/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"SIL Open Font License 1.1","redistributable":true,"shortName":"ofl","spdxId":"OFL-1.1","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/OFL-1.1.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["hyperscrypt-font"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/data/fonts/hyperscrypt/default.nix:20","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["hyperscrypt-font"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/data/fonts/hyperscrypt/default.nix:20","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","aarch64-genode","i686-genode","x86_64-genode","x86_64-solaris","js-ghcjs","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","mmix-mmixware","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","aarch64-none","arm-none","armv6l-none","avr-none","i686-none","msp430-none","or1k-none","m68k-none","powerpc-none","riscv32-none","riscv64-none","s390-none","s390x-none","vc4-none","x86_64-none","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","x86_64-windows","i686-windows"]}}
