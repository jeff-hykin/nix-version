{"frozen":{"name":"hyperscrypt-font","shortDescription":"A modern stencil typeface inspired by stained glass technique","longDescription":"The Hyper Scrypt typeface was designed for the Hyper Chapelle\nexhibition. It was commissioned by AAAAA Atelier to Studio\nTriple's designer Jérémy Landes.  Hyper Scrypt is a modern\nstencil typeface inspired by the stained glass technique used in\nthe Metz cathedral. It borrows the stained glass method, drawing\nholes for the light with black lead. This creates a reverse\ntypeface, where the shapes of the letters are drawn by their\ncounters. Hyper Scrypt is at the intersection between 3 metals :\nthe sacred lead of stained glass, the lead of print characters\nand the heavy metal. Despite its organic look inherited for the\nmolted metal, Hyper Scrypt is based upon a rigorous grid,\nallowing some neat alignements between shapes in multi lines\nlayouts.\n","versionString":"1.1","homepage":"http://velvetyne.fr/fonts/hyper-scrypt/","license":{"fullName":"SIL Open Font License 1.1","shortName":"ofl","spdxId":"OFL-1.1","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/OFL-1.1.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["hyperscrypt-font"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/data/fonts/hyperscrypt/default.nix:20","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
