{"frozen":{"name":"sharutils","shortDescription":"Tools for remote synchronization and `shell archives'","longDescription":"GNU shar makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing\n        them for transmission by electronic mail services.  A shell archive\n        is a collection of files that can be unpacked by /bin/sh.  A wide\n        range of features provide extensive flexibility in manufacturing\n        shars and in specifying shar smartness.  For example, shar may\n        compress files, uuencode binary files, split long files and\n        construct multi-part mailings, ensure correct unsharing order, and\n        provide simplistic checksums.\n\n        GNU unshar scans a set of mail messages looking for the start of\n        shell archives.  It will automatically strip off the mail headers\n        and other introductory text.  The archive bodies are then unpacked\n        by a copy of the shell. unshar may also process files containing\n        concatenated shell archives.\n","versionString":"4.15.2","homepage":"https://www.gnu.org/software/sharutils/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[4,15,2]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["sharutils"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/archivers/sharutils/default.nix:50","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["sharutils"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/archivers/sharutils/default.nix:50","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-windows","i686-windows","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","arm-none","armv6l-none","aarch64-none","avr-none","i686-none","x86_64-none","powerpc-none","msp430-none","riscv64-none","riscv32-none","vc4-none","or1k-none","mmix-mmixware","js-ghcjs","aarch64-genode","i686-genode","x86_64-genode"]}}
