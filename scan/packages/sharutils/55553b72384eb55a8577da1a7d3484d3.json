{"frozen":{"name":"sharutils","shortDescription":"Tools for remote synchronization and `shell archives'","longDescription":"GNU shar makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing\n        them for transmission by electronic mail services.  A shell archive\n        is a collection of files that can be unpacked by /bin/sh.  A wide\n        range of features provide extensive flexibility in manufacturing\n        shars and in specifying shar smartness.  For example, shar may\n        compress files, uuencode binary files, split long files and\n        construct multi-part mailings, ensure correct unsharing order, and\n        provide simplistic checksums.\n\n        GNU unshar scans a set of mail messages looking for the start of\n        shell archives.  It will automatically strip off the mail headers\n        and other introductory text.  The archive bodies are then unpacked\n        by a copy of the shell. unshar may also process files containing\n        concatenated shell archives.\n","versionString":"4.15.2","homepage":"https://www.gnu.org/software/sharutils/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[4,15,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["sharutils"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/archivers/sharutils/default.nix:46","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
