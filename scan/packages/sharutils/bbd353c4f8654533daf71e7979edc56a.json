{"frozen":{"name":"sharutils","shortDescription":"Tools for remote synchronization and `shell archives'","longDescription":"GNU shar makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing\n        them for transmission by electronic mail services.  A shell archive\n        is a collection of files that can be unpacked by /bin/sh.  A wide\n        range of features provide extensive flexibility in manufacturing\n        shars and in specifying shar smartness.  For example, shar may\n        compress files, uuencode binary files, split long files and\n        construct multi-part mailings, ensure correct unsharing order, and\n        provide simplistic checksums.\n\n        GNU unshar scans a set of mail messages looking for the start of\n        shell archives.  It will automatically strip off the mail headers\n        and other introductory text.  The archive bodies are then unpacked\n        by a copy of the shell. unshar may also process files containing\n        concatenated shell archives.\n","versionString":"4.11.1","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/sharutils/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0+"},"versionNumberList":[4,11,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["sharutils"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/archivers/sharutils/default.nix:27","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
