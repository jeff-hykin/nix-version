{"frozen":{"name":"ccnx","shortDescription":"A Named Data Neworking (NDN) or Content Centric Networking (CCN) abstraction","longDescription":"To address the Internet’s modern-day requirements with a better\nfitting model, PARC has created a new networking architecture\ncalled Content-Centric Networking (CCN), which operates by addressing\nand delivering Content Objects directly by Name instead of merely\naddressing network end-points. In addition, the CCN security model\nexplicitly secures individual Content Objects rather than securing\nthe connection or “pipe”. Named and secured content resides in\ndistributed caches automatically populated on demand or selectively\npre-populated. When requested by name, CCN delivers named content to\nthe user from the nearest cache, thereby traversing fewer network hops,\neliminating redundant requests, and consuming less resources overall.\n","versionString":"0.8.2","homepage":"http://www.ccnx.org/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0"},"versionNumberList":[0,8,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["ccnx"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/ccnx/default.nix:20","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
