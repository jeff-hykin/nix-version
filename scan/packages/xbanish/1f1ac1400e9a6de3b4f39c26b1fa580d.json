{"frozen":{"name":"xbanish","shortDescription":"Hides mouse pointer while not in use","longDescription":"xbanish hides the mouse cursor when you start typing, and shows it again when\nthe mouse cursor moves or a mouse button is pressed.  This is similar to\nxterm's pointerMode setting, but xbanish works globally in the X11 session.\n\nunclutter's -keystroke mode is supposed to do this, but it's broken[0].  I\nlooked into fixing it, but the unclutter source code is terrible, so I wrote\nxbanish.\n\nThe name comes from ratpoison's \"banish\" command that sends the cursor to the\ncorner of the screen.\n","versionString":"1.7","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,7]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["xbanish"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/X11/xbanish/default.nix:25","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
