{"frozen":{"name":"xbanish","shortDescription":"Hides mouse pointer while not in use","longDescription":"xbanish hides the mouse cursor when you start typing, and shows it again when\nthe mouse cursor moves or a mouse button is pressed.  This is similar to\nxterm's pointerMode setting, but xbanish works globally in the X11 session.\n\nunclutter's -keystroke mode is supposed to do this, but it's broken[0].  I\nlooked into fixing it, but the unclutter source code is terrible, so I wrote\nxbanish.\n\nThe name comes from ratpoison's \"banish\" command that sends the cursor to the\ncorner of the screen.\n","versionString":"1.5","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,5]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["xbanish"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/X11/xbanish/default.nix:25","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
