We remove extraneous syntax (e.g. no XML literals),\nand try to boil down Scalaâ€™s types into a smaller set of more fundamental constructs.\nThe theory behind these constructs is researched in DOT, a calculus for dependent object types.\n","versionString":"0.10.0-RC1","homepage":"http://dotty.epfl.ch/","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,10,0,"-RC1"]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["dotty"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/compilers/scala/dotty-bare.nix:28","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
