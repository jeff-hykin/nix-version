{"frozen":{"name":"plib","shortDescription":"A suite of portable game libraries","longDescription":"PLIB includes sound effects, music, a complete 3D engine, font\nrendering, a simple Windowing library, a game scripting\nlanguage, a GUI, networking, 3D math library and a collection of\nhandy utility functions.  All are 100% portable across nearly\nall modern computing platforms.  What's more, it's all available\non line - and completely free.  Each library component is fairly\nindependent of the others - so if you want to use SDL, GTK,\nGLUT, or FLTK instead of PLIB's 'PW' windowing library, you can.\n","versionString":"1.8.5","homepage":"http://plib.sourceforge.net/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,8,5]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["plib"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/plib/default.nix:32","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
