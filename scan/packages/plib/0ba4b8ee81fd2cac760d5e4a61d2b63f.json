All are 100% portable across nearly\nall modern computing platforms.  What's more, it's all available\non line - and completely free.  Each library component is fairly\nindependent of the others - so if you want to use SDL, GTK,\nGLUT, or FLTK instead of PLIB's 'PW' windowing library, you can.\n","versionString":"1.8.5","homepage":"http://plib.sourceforge.net/","license":"LGPLv2+","versionNumberList":[1,8,5]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["plib"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}]}}
