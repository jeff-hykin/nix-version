{"frozen":{"name":"plib","shortDescription":"A suite of portable game libraries","longDescription":"PLIB includes sound effects, music, a complete 3D engine, font\nrendering, a simple Windowing library, a game scripting\nlanguage, a GUI, networking, 3D math library and a collection of\nhandy utility functions.  All are 100% portable across nearly\nall modern computing platforms.  What's more, it's all available\non line - and completely free.  Each library component is fairly\nindependent of the others - so if you want to use SDL, GTK,\nGLUT, or FLTK instead of PLIB's 'PW' windowing library, you can.\n","versionString":"1.8.5","homepage":"http://plib.sourceforge.net/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0+"},"versionNumberList":[1,8,5]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["plib"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/plib/default.nix:24","date":"2015-08-08"}]}}
