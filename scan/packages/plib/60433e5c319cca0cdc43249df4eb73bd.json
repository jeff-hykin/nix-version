{"frozen":{"name":"plib","shortDescription":"A suite of portable game libraries","longDescription":"PLIB includes sound effects, music, a complete 3D engine, font\nrendering, a simple Windowing library, a game scripting\nlanguage, a GUI, networking, 3D math library and a collection of\nhandy utility functions.  All are 100% portable across nearly\nall modern computing platforms.  What's more, it's all available\non line - and completely free.  Each library component is fairly\nindependent of the others - so if you want to use SDL, GTK,\nGLUT, or FLTK instead of PLIB's 'PW' windowing library, you can.\n","versionString":"1.8.5","homepage":"http://plib.sourceforge.net/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,8,5]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["plib"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/plib/default.nix:33","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["plib"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/plib/default.nix:33","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
