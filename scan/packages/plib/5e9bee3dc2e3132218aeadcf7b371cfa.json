{"frozen":{"name":"plib","shortDescription":"A suite of portable game libraries","longDescription":"PLIB includes sound effects, music, a complete 3D engine, font\nrendering, a simple Windowing library, a game scripting\nlanguage, a GUI, networking, 3D math library and a collection of\nhandy utility functions.  All are 100% portable across nearly\nall modern computing platforms.  What's more, it's all available\non line - and completely free.  Each library component is fairly\nindependent of the others - so if you want to use SDL, GTK,\nGLUT, or FLTK instead of PLIB's 'PW' windowing library, you can.\n","versionString":"1.8.5","homepage":"http://plib.sourceforge.net/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,8,5]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["plib"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/plib/default.nix:32","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["plib"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/plib/default.nix:32","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
