{"frozen":{"name":"bitcoind-xt","shortDescription":"Peer-to-peer electronic cash system (XT client)","longDescription":"Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is\ncompletely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted\nparties. Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly\nwith each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.\n\nBitcoin XT is an implementation of a Bitcoin full node, based upon the\nsource code of Bitcoin Core. It is built by taking the latest stable\nCore release, applying a series of patches, and then doing deterministic\nbuilds so anyone can check the downloads correspond to the source code.\n","versionString":"0.11H","homepage":"https://bitcoinxt.software/","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,11,"H"]},"flexible":{"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["altcoins","bitcoind-xt"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/altcoins/bitcoin-xt.nix:33","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"families":{"bsd":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"bsd"}}}},{"kernel":{"families":{"darwin":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"darwin"}}}},{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}},{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"solaris"}},{"abi":{"_type":"abi","name":"cygnus"},"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"pe"},"families":{},"name":"windows"}}]}}
