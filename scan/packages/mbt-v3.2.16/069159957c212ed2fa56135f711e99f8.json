{"frozen":{"name":"mbt-v3.2.16","shortDescription":"Memory Based Tagger","longDescription":"MBT is a memory-based tagger-generator and tagger in one. The tagger-generator part can generate a sequence tagger on the basis of a training set of tagged sequences; the tagger part can tag new sequences. MBT can, for instance, be used to generate part-of-speech taggers or chunkers for natural language processing. It has also been used for named-entity recognition, information extraction in domain-specific texts, and disfluency chunking in transcribed speech.\n\nMbt is used by Frog for Dutch tagging.\n","versionString":"mbt-v3.2.16","homepage":"https://languagemachines.github.io/mbt/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 only","shortName":"gpl3","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,2,16]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["languageMachines","mbt"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/languagemachines/mbt.nix:28","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
