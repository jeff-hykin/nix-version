{"frozen":{"name":"orbitron","shortDescription":"Geometric sans-serif for display purposes by Matt McInerney","longDescription":"Orbitron is a geometric sans-serif typeface intended for display\npurposes. It features four weights (light, medium, bold, and\nblack), a stylistic alternative, small caps, and a ton of\nalternate glyphs.\n\nOrbitron was designed so that graphic designers in the future\nwill have some alternative to typefaces like Eurostile or Bank\nGothic. If youâ€™ve ever seen a futuristic sci-fi movie, you have\nmay noticed that all other fonts have been lost or destroyed in\nthe apocalypse that led humans to flee earth. Only those very few\ngeometric typefaces have survived to be used on spaceship\nexteriors, space station signage, monopolistic corporate\nbranding, uniforms featuring aerodynamic shoulder pads, etc. Of\ncourse Orbitron could also be used on the posters for the movies\nportraying this inevitable future.\n","versionString":"20110526","homepage":"https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/orbitron","license":{"fullName":"SIL Open Font License 1.1","shortName":"ofl","spdxId":"OFL-1.1","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/OFL-1.1.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["orbitron"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/data/fonts/orbitron/default.nix:23","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
