{"frozen":{"name":"clipster","shortDescription":"lightweight python clipboard manager","longDescription":"Clipster was designed to try to add a good selection of useful features, while avoiding bad design decisions or becoming excessively large.\nIts feature list includes:\n- Event driven, rather than polling. More efficient, helps with power management.\n- Control over when it write to disk, for similar reasons.\n- Command-line options/config for everything.\n- No global keybindings - that's the job of a Window Manager\n- Sensible handling of unusual clipboard events. Some apps (Chrome, Emacs) trigger a clipboard 'update event' for every character you select, rather than just one event when you stop selecting.\n- Preserves the last item in clipboard after an application closes. (Many apps clear the clipboard on exit).\n- Minimal dependencies, no complicated build/install requirements.\n- utf-8 support\n- Proper handling of embedded newlines and control codes.\n- Smart matching of urls, emails, regexes. (extract_*)\n- Option to synchronise the SELECTION and CLIPBOARD clipboards. (sync_selections)\n- Option to track one or both clipboards. (active_selections)\n- Option to ignore clipboard updates form certain applications. (filter_classes)\n- Ability to delete items in clipboard history.\n","versionString":"2.0.2","homepage":"https://github.com/mrichar1/clipster","license":{"deprecated":true,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU Affero General Public License v3.0","redistributable":true,"shortName":"agpl3","spdxId":"AGPL-3.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,0,2]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["clipster"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/clipster/default.nix:26","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["clipster"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/clipster/default.nix:26","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
