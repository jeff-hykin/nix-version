{"frozen":{"name":"clipster","shortDescription":"lightweight python clipboard manager","longDescription":"Clipster was designed to try to add a good selection of useful features, while avoiding bad design decisions or becoming excessively large.\nIts feature list includes:\n- Event driven, rather than polling. More efficient, helps with power management.\n- Control over when it write to disk, for similar reasons.\n- Command-line options/config for everything.\n- No global keybindings - that's the job of a Window Manager\n- Sensible handling of unusual clipboard events. Some apps (Chrome, Emacs) trigger a clipboard 'update event' for every character you select, rather than just one event when you stop selecting.\n- Preserves the last item in clipboard after an application closes. (Many apps clear the clipboard on exit).\n- Minimal dependencies, no complicated build/install requirements.\n- utf-8 support\n- Proper handling of embedded newlines and control codes.\n- Smart matching of urls, emails, regexes. (extract_*)\n- Option to synchronise the SELECTION and CLIPBOARD clipboards. (sync_selections)\n- Option to track one or both clipboards. (active_selections)\n- Option to ignore clipboard updates form certain applications.
