It is particularly well-suited to problems where\n                cable properties of cells play an important role, possibly including extracellular\n                potential close to the membrane), and where cell membrane properties are complex,\n                involving many ion-specific channels, ion accumulation, and second messengers","versionString":"7.5","homepage":"http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[7,5]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["neuron-mpi"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/biology/neuron/default.nix:66","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
