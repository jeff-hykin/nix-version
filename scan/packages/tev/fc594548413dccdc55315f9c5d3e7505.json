{"frozen":{"name":"tev","shortDescription":"A high dynamic range (HDR) image comparison tool","longDescription":"A high dynamic range (HDR) image comparison tool for graphics people. tev\nallows viewing images through various tonemapping operators and inspecting\nthe values of individual pixels. Often, it is important to find exact\ndifferences between pairs of images. For this purpose, tev allows rapidly\nswitching between opened images and visualizing various error metrics (L1,\nL2, and relative versions thereof). To avoid clutter, opened images and\ntheir layers can be filtered by keywords.\nWhile the predominantly supported file format is OpenEXR certain other\ntypes of images can also be loaded.\n","versionString":"1.17","homepage":"https://github.com/Tom94/tev","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,17]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["tev"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/graphics/tev/default.nix:40","date":"2021-10-20"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-solaris","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox"]}}
