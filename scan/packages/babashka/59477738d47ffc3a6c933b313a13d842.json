{"frozen":{"name":"babashka","shortDescription":"A Clojure babushka for the grey areas of Bash","longDescription":"  The main idea behind babashka is to leverage Clojure in places where you\n  would be using bash otherwise.\n\n  As one user described it:\n\n      I’m quite at home in Bash most of the time, but there’s a substantial\n      grey area of things that are too complicated to be simple in bash, but\n      too simple to be worth writing a clj/s script for. Babashka really\n      seems to hit the sweet spot for those cases.\n\nGoals:\n\n- Low latency Clojure scripting alternative to JVM Clojure.\n- Easy installation: grab the self-contained binary and run. No JVM needed.\n- Familiarity and portability:\n  - Scripts should be compatible with JVM Clojure as much as possible\n  - Scripts should be platform-independent as much as possible. Babashka\n    offers support for linux, macOS and Windows.\n- Allow interop with commonly used classes like java.io.File and System\n- Multi-threading support (pmap, future, core.async)\n- Batteries included (tools.cli, cheshire, ...)\n- Library support via popular tools like the clojure CLI\n","versionString":"0.6.1","homepage":"https://github.com/babashka/babashka","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"Eclipse Public License 1.0","redistributable":true,"shortName":"epl10","spdxId":"EPL-1.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/EPL-1.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,6,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["babashka"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/development/interpreters/clojure/babashka.nix:62","date":"2021-10-20"}],"platforms":["x86_64-linux","aarch64-linux","x86_64-darwin"]}}
