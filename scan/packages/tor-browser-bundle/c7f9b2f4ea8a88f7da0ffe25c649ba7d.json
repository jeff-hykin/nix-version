{"frozen":{"name":"tor-browser-bundle","shortDescription":"An unofficial version of the Tor Browser Bundle, built from source","longDescription":"Tor Browser Bundle is a bundle of the Tor daemon, Tor Browser (heavily patched version of\nFirefox), several essential extensions for Tor Browser, and some tools that glue those\ntogether with a convenient UI.\n\n`tor-browser-bundle-bin` package is the official version built by torproject.org patched with\n`patchelf` to work under nix and with bundled scripts adapted to the read-only nature of\nthe `/nix/store`.\n\n`tor-browser-bundle` package is the version built completely from source. It reuses the `tor`\npackage for the tor daemon, `firefoxPackages.tor-browser` package for the tor-browser, and\nbuilds all the extensions from source.\n\nNote that `tor-browser-bundle` package is not only built from source, but also bundles Tor\nBrowser differently from the official `tor-browser-bundle-bin` implementation. The official\nTor Browser is not a normal UNIX program and is heavily patched for its use in the Tor Browser\nBundle (which `tor-browser-bundle-bin` package then has to work around for the read-only\n/nix/store). Meanwhile, `firefoxPackages.tor-browser` reverts all those patches, allowing\n`firefoxPackages.tor-browser` to be used independently of the bundle, and then implements what\n`tor-browser-bundle` needs for the bundling using a much simpler patch. See the\nlongDescription and expression of the `firefoxPackages.tor-browser` package for more info.\n","versionString":"8.0.6","homepage":"https://torproject.org/","license":{"fullName":"Unspecified free software license","shortName":"free"},"versionNumberList":[8,0,6]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["tor-browser-bundle"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/networking/browsers/tor-browser-bundle/default.nix:320","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":["x86_64-linux"]}}
