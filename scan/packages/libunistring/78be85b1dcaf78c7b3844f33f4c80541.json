The text\nprocessing functions provided by this library handle all scripts\nand all languages.\n\nlibunistring is for you if your application already uses the ISO\nC / POSIX <ctype.h>, <wctype.h> functions and the text it\noperates on is provided by the user and can be in any language.\n\nlibunistring is also for you if your application uses Unicode\nstrings as internal in-memory representation.\n","versionString":"0.9.6","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/libunistring/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"lgpl3Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-3.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0+"},"versionNumberList":[0,9,6]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["libunistring"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/libunistring/default.nix:26","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
