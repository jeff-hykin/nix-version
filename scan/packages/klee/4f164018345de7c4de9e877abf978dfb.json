{"frozen":{"name":"klee","shortDescription":"A symbolic virtual machine built on top of LLVM","longDescription":"KLEE is a symbolic virtual machine built on top of the LLVM compiler\ninfrastructure. Currently, there are two primary components:\n\n1. The core symbolic virtual machine engine; this is responsible for\n   executing LLVM bitcode modules with support for symbolic values. This\n   is comprised of the code in lib/.\n\n2. A POSIX/Linux emulation layer oriented towards supporting uClibc, with\n   additional support for making parts of the operating system environment\n   symbolic.\n\nAdditionally, there is a simple library for replaying computed inputs on\nnative code (for closed programs). There is also a more complicated\ninfrastructure for replaying the inputs generated for the POSIX/Linux\nemulation layer, which handles running native programs in an environment\nthat matches a computed test input, including setting up files, pipes,\nenvironment variables, and passing command line arguments.\n","versionString":"2.2","homepage":"https://klee.github.io/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"ncsa","spdxId":"NCSA","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/NCSA.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,2]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["klee"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/logic/klee/default.nix:85","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["x86_64-linux"]}}
