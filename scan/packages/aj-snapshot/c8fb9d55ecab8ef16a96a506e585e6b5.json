{"frozen":{"name":"aj-snapshot","shortDescription":"Tool for storing/restoring JACK and/or ALSA connections to/from cml files","longDescription":"Aj-snapshot is a small program that can be used to make snapshots of the connections made between JACK and/or ALSA clients. \nBecause JACK can provide both audio and MIDI support to programs, aj-snapshot can store both types of connections for JACK. \nALSA, on the other hand, only provides routing facilities for MIDI clients. \nYou can also run aj-snapshot in daemon mode if you want to have your connections continually restored.\n","versionString":"0.9.8","homepage":"http://aj-snapshot.sourceforge.net/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,9,8]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["aj-snapshot"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/aj-snapshot/default.nix:19","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
