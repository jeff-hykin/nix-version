{"frozen":{"name":"pharo-launcher","shortDescription":"Launcher for Pharo distributions","longDescription":"\nPharo's goal is to deliver a clean, innovative, free open-source\nSmalltalk-inspired environment. By providing a stable and small\ncore system, excellent dev tools, and maintained releases, Pharo\nis an attractive platform to build and deploy mission critical\napplications.\n\nThe Pharo Launcher is a cross-platform application that\n  - lets you manage your Pharo images (launch, rename, copy and delete);\n  - lets you download image templates (i.e., zip archives) from many\n    different sources (e.g., Jenkins, files.pharo.org);\n  - lets you create new images from any template.\n\nThe idea behind the Pharo Launcher is that you should be able to\naccess it very rapidly from your OS application launcher. As a\nresult, launching any image is never more than 3 clicks away.\n","versionString":"2017.02.28","homepage":"http://pharo.org","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[2017,2,28]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["pharo-launcher"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/pharo/launcher/default.nix:59","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","aarch64-linux","powerpc64le-linux"]}}
