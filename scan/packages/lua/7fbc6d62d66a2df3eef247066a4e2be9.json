Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode\nfor a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory\nmanagement with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal\nfor configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.\n","versionString":"5.3.0","homepage":"http://www.lua.org","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT"},"versionNumberList":[5,3,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["lua5_3_compat"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/interpreters/lua-5/5.3.nix:89","date":"2015-08-08"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["lua5_3"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/interpreters/lua-5/5.3.nix:89","date":"2015-08-08"}]}}
