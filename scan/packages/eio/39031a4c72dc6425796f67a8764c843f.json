It is also ported to Windows, so multi-platform.\n\nWhenever you need to list a directory, copy, move or delete files, Eio will do that\ntask better than you'd achieve with naive implementations, and it is easy to use. \n","versionString":"1.7.5","homepage":"http://enlightenment.org/","license":"LGPLv2.1","versionNumberList":[1,7,5]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["e17","eio"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}]}}
