It allows the\nprogrammer to set up virtual 'screens' and send them data. The virtual\nscreens will emulate the behavior of a VT102 terminal, interpreting\nescape sequences, control characters and such. The library supports\nncurses as well so that you may render the virtual screen to the real\nscreen when you need to.\n","versionString":"0.2.8","homepage":"http://rote.sourceforge.net/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 only","shortName":"lgpl21","spdxId":"LGPL-2.1-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,2,8]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["rote"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/rote/default.nix:17","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
