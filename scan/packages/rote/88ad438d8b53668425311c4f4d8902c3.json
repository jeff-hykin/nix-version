It allows the\nprogrammer to set up virtual 'screens' and send them data. The virtual\nscreens will emulate the behavior of a VT102 terminal, interpreting\nescape sequences, control characters and such. The library supports\nncurses as well so that you may render the virtual screen to the real\nscreen when you need to.\n","versionString":"0.2.8","homepage":"http://rote.sourceforge.net/","license":{"deprecated":true,"fullName":"GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1","spdxId":"LGPL-2.1","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,2,8]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["rote"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/rote/default.nix:17","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
