It allows the\nprogrammer to set up virtual 'screens' and send them data. The virtual\nscreens will emulate the behavior of a VT102 terminal, interpreting\nescape sequences, control characters and such. The library supports\nncurses as well so that you may render the virtual screen to the real\nscreen when you need to.\n","versionString":"0.2.8","homepage":"http://rote.sourceforge.net/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2.1 only","shortName":"lgpl21","spdxId":"LGPL-2.1-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,2,8]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["rote"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/rote/default.nix:17","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
