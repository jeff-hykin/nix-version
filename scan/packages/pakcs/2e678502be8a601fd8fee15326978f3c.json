{"frozen":{"name":"pakcs","shortDescription":"An implementation of the multi-paradigm declarative language Curry","longDescription":"PAKCS is an implementation of the multi-paradigm declarative language\nCurry jointly developed by the Portland State University, the Aachen\nUniversity of Technology, and the University of Kiel. Although this is\nnot a highly optimized implementation but based on a high-level\ncompilation of Curry programs into Prolog programs, it is not a toy\nimplementation but has been used for a variety of applications (e.g.,\ngraphical programming environments, an object-oriented front-end for\nCurry, partial evaluators, database applications, HTML programming\nwith dynamic web pages, prototyping embedded systems).\n","versionString":"2.2.1","homepage":"http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~pakcs/","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,2,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["pakcs"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/compilers/pakcs/default.nix:82","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
