{"frozen":{"name":"pakcs","shortDescription":"An implementation of the multi-paradigm declarative language Curry","longDescription":"PAKCS is an implementation of the multi-paradigm declarative language\nCurry jointly developed by the Portland State University, the Aachen\nUniversity of Technology, and the University of Kiel. Although this is\nnot a highly optimized implementation but based on a high-level\ncompilation of Curry programs into Prolog programs, it is not a toy\nimplementation but has been used for a variety of applications (e.g.,\ngraphical programming environments, an object-oriented front-end for\nCurry, partial evaluators, database applications, HTML programming\nwith dynamic web pages, prototyping embedded systems).\n","versionString":"1.11.2","homepage":"http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~pakcs/","license":{"fullName":"BSD license (3 clause)","shortName":"BSD-3","url":"http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause"},"versionNumberList":[1,11,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["haskellPackages","pakcs"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["haskellPackages_ghc763_profiling","pakcs"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["haskellPackages_ghc763_no_profiling","pakcs"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
