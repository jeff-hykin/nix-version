{"frozen":{"name":"slang","shortDescription":"A small, embeddable multi-platform programming library","longDescription":"S-Lang is an interpreted language that was designed from the start to be\neasily embedded into a program to provide it with a powerful extension\nlanguage. Examples of programs that use S-Lang as an extension language\ninclude the jed text editor and the slrn newsreader. Although S-Lang does\nnot exist as a separate application, it is distributed with a quite\ncapable program called slsh (\"slang-shell\") that embeds the interpreter\nand allows one to execute S-Lang scripts, or simply experiment with S-Lang\nat an interactive prompt. Many of the the examples in this document are\npresented in the context of one of the above applications.\n\nS-Lang is also a programmer's library that permits a programmer to develop\nsophisticated platform-independent software. In addition to providing the\nS-Lang interpreter, the library provides facilities for screen management,\nkeymaps, low-level terminal I/O, etc. However, this document is concerned\nonly with the extension language and does not address these other features\nof the S-Lang library. For information about the other components of the\nlibrary, the reader is referred to the S-Lang Library C Programmer's\nGuide.\n","versionString":"2.3.2","homepage":"http://www.jedsoft.org/slang/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,3,2]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["slang"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/slang/default.nix:56","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["slang"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/slang/default.nix:56","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-solaris","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox"]}}
