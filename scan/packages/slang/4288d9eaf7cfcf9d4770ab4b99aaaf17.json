{"frozen":{"name":"slang","shortDescription":"A small, embeddable multi-platform programming library","longDescription":"S-Lang is an interpreted language that was designed from the start to be\neasily embedded into a program to provide it with a powerful extension\nlanguage. Examples of programs that use S-Lang as an extension language\ninclude the jed text editor and the slrn newsreader. Although S-Lang does\nnot exist as a separate application, it is distributed with a quite\ncapable program called slsh (\"slang-shell\") that embeds the interpreter\nand allows one to execute S-Lang scripts, or simply experiment with S-Lang\nat an interactive prompt. Many of the the examples in this document are\npresented in the context of one of the above applications.\n\nS-Lang is also a programmer's library that permits a programmer to develop\nsophisticated platform-independent software. In addition to providing the\nS-Lang interpreter, the library provides facilities for screen management,\nkeymaps, low-level terminal I/O, etc. However, this document is concerned\nonly with the extension language and does not address these other features\nof the S-Lang library. For information about the other components of the\nlibrary, the reader is referred to the S-Lang Library C Programmer's\nGuide.\n","versionString":"2.3.2","homepage":"http://www.jedsoft.org/slang/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,3,2]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["slang"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/slang/default.nix:56","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
