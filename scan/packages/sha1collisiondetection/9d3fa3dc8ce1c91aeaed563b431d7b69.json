They will\ncompute the SHA-1 hash of any given file and additionally will\ndetect cryptanalytic collision attacks against SHA-1 present in\neach file. It is very fast and takes less than twice the amount\nof time as regular SHA-1.\n","versionString":"1.0.3","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,0,3]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["sha1collisiondetection"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/security/sha1collisiondetection/default.nix:21","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
