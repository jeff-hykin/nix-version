IPTraf-ng\ngathers data like TCP connection packet and byte counts, interface\nstatistics and activity indicators, TCP/UDP traffic breakdowns, and LAN\nstation packet and byte counts. IPTraf-ng features include an IP traffic\nmonitor which shows TCP flag information, packet and byte counts, ICMP\ndetails, OSPF packet types, and oversized IP packet warnings; interface\nstatistics showing IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, non-IP and other IP packet counts,\nIP checksum errors, interface activity and packet size counts; a TCP and\nUDP service monitor showing counts of incoming and outgoing packets for\ncommon TCP and UDP application ports, a LAN statistics module that\ndiscovers active hosts and displays statistics about their activity; TCP,\nUDP and other protocol display filters so you can view just the traffic\nyou want; logging; support for Ethernet, FDDI, ISDN, SLIP, PPP, and\nloopback interfaces; and utilization of the built-in raw socket interface\nof the Linux kernel, so it can be used on a wide variety of supported\nnetwork cards.\n","versionString":"1.2.1","homepage":"https://github.com/iptraf-ng/iptraf-ng","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2Only","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,2,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["iptraf-ng"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/networking/iptraf-ng/default.nix:25","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
