It is based on the optimizing native code\ncompiler, the native runtime and an earlier prototype by Alain\nFrisch. It is build upon Just-In-Time techniques and currently\nsupports Unix-like systems (i.e. Linux, BSD or Mac OS X) running on\nx86 or x86-64 processors. Support for additional architectures and\noperating systems is planned, but not yet available.\n","versionString":"0.1.1","homepage":"http://benediktmeurer.de/ocamlnat/","license":{"fullName":"Q Public License 1.0","shortName":"qpl","spdxId":"QPL-1.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/QPL-1.0"},"versionNumberList":[0,1,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["ocamlnat"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/ocaml-modules/ocamlnat/default.nix:22","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin"]}}
