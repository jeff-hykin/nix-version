{"frozen":{"name":"ott","shortDescription":"A tool for the working semanticist","longDescription":"Ott is a tool for writing definitions of programming languages and\ncalculi. It takes as input a definition of a language syntax and\nsemantics, in a concise and readable ASCII notation that is close to\nwhat one would write in informal mathematics. It generates LaTeX to\nbuild a typeset version of the definition, and Coq, HOL, and Isabelle\nversions of the definition. Additionally, it can be run as a filter,\ntaking a LaTeX/Coq/Isabelle/HOL source file with embedded (symbolic)\nterms of the defined language, parsing them and replacing them by\ntarget-system terms.\n","versionString":"0.31","homepage":"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,31]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["ott"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/logic/ott/default.nix:28","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
