{"frozen":{"name":"ott","shortDescription":"A tool for the working semanticist","longDescription":"Ott is a tool for writing definitions of programming languages and\ncalculi. It takes as input a definition of a language syntax and\nsemantics, in a concise and readable ASCII notation that is close to\nwhat one would write in informal mathematics. It generates LaTeX to\nbuild a typeset version of the definition, and Coq, HOL, and Isabelle\nversions of the definition. Additionally, it can be run as a filter,\ntaking a LaTeX/Coq/Isabelle/HOL source file with embedded (symbolic)\nterms of the defined language, parsing them and replacing them by\ntarget-system terms.\n","versionString":"0.31","homepage":"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,31]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["ott"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/logic/ott/default.nix:28","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["ott"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/logic/ott/default.nix:28","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-solaris","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox"]}}
