{"frozen":{"name":"git-crypt","shortDescription":"Transparent file encryption in git","longDescription":"git-crypt enables transparent encryption and decryption of files in a git\nrepository. Files which you choose to protect are encrypted when\ncommitted, and decrypted when checked out. git-crypt lets you freely\nshare a repository containing a mix of public and private\ncontent. git-crypt gracefully degrades, so developers without the secret\nkey can still clone and commit to a repository with encrypted files. This\nlets you store your secret material (such as keys or passwords) in the\nsame repository as your code, without requiring you to lock down your\nentire repository.\n","versionString":"0.6.0","homepage":"https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt","license":{"deprecated":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0","spdxId":"GPL-3.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,6,0]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["git-crypt"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/version-management/git-and-tools/git-crypt/default.nix:37","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
