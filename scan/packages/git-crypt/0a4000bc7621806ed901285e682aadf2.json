{"frozen":{"name":"git-crypt","shortDescription":"transparent file encryption in git","longDescription":"git-crypt enables transparent encryption and decryption of files in a git\nrepository. Files which you choose to protect are encrypted when\ncommitted, and decrypted when checked out. git-crypt lets you freely\nshare a repository containing a mix of public and private\ncontent. git-crypt gracefully degrades, so developers without the secret\nkey can still clone and commit to a repository with encrypted files. This\nlets you store your secret material (such as keys or passwords) in the\nsame repository as your code, without requiring you to lock down your\nentire repository.\n","versionString":"0.5.0","homepage":"https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 only","shortName":"gpl3","spdxId":"GPL-3.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0"},"versionNumberList":[0,5,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["gitAndTools","git-crypt"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/version-management/git-and-tools/git-crypt/default.nix:23","date":"2015-08-08"}]}}
