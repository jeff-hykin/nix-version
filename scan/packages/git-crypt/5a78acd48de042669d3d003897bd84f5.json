{"frozen":{"name":"git-crypt","shortDescription":"Transparent file encryption in git","longDescription":"git-crypt enables transparent encryption and decryption of files in a git\nrepository. Files which you choose to protect are encrypted when\ncommitted, and decrypted when checked out. git-crypt lets you freely\nshare a repository containing a mix of public and private\ncontent. git-crypt gracefully degrades, so developers without the secret\nkey can still clone and commit to a repository with encrypted files. This\nlets you store your secret material (such as keys or passwords) in the\nsame repository as your code, without requiring you to lock down your\nentire repository.\n","versionString":"0.6.0","homepage":"https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 only","shortName":"gpl3","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,6,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["git-crypt"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/version-management/git-and-tools/git-crypt/default.nix:37","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
