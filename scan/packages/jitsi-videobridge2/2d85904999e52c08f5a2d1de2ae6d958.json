{"frozen":{"name":"jitsi-videobridge2","shortDescription":"A WebRTC compatible video router","longDescription":"Jitsi Videobridge is an XMPP server component that allows for multiuser video communication.\nUnlike the expensive dedicated hardware videobridges, Jitsi Videobridge does not mix the video\nchannels into a composite video stream, but only relays the received video channels to all call\nparticipants. Therefore, while it does need to run on a server with good network bandwidth,\nCPU horsepower is not that critical for performance.\n","versionString":"2.1-416-g2f43d1b4","homepage":"https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-videobridge","license":{"fullName":"Apache License 2.0","shortName":"asl20","spdxId":"Apache-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,1,"-416-g2f43d1b4"]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["jitsi-videobridge"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/servers/jitsi-videobridge/default.nix:42","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
