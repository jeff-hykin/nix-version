{"frozen":{"name":"guitarix","shortDescription":"A virtual guitar amplifier for Linux running with JACK","longDescription":"  guitarix is a virtual guitar amplifier for Linux running with\nJACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit). It is free as in speech and\nfree as in beer. Its free sourcecode allows to build it for\nother UNIX-like systems also, namely for BSD and for MacOSX.\n\n  It takes the signal from your guitar as any real amp would do:\nas a mono-signal from your sound card. Your tone is processed by\na main amp and a rack-section. Both can be routed separately and\ndeliver a processed stereo-signal via JACK. You may fill the\nrack with effects from more than 25 built-in modules spanning\nfrom a simple noise-gate to brain-slashing modulation-fx like\nflanger, phaser or auto-wah. Your signal is processed with\nminimum latency. On any properly set-up Linux-system you do not\nneed to wait for more than 10 milli-seconds for your playing to\nbe delivered, processed by guitarix.\n\n  guitarix offers the range of sounds you would expect from a\nfull-featured universal guitar-amp. You can get crisp\nclean-sounds, nice overdrive, fat distortion and a diversity of\ncrazy sounds never heard before.\n","versionString":"0.37.3","homepage":"http://guitarix.sourceforge.net/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,37,3]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["guitarix"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/guitarix/default.nix:42","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
