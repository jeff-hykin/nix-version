{"frozen":{"name":"guitarix","shortDescription":"A virtual guitar amplifier for Linux running with JACK","longDescription":"  guitarix is a virtual guitar amplifier for Linux running with\nJACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit). It is free as in speech and\nfree as in beer. Its free sourcecode allows to build it for\nother UNIX-like systems also, namely for BSD and for MacOSX.\n\n  It takes the signal from your guitar as any real amp would do:\nas a mono-signal from your sound card. Your tone is processed by\na main amp and a rack-section. Both can be routed separately and\ndeliver a processed stereo-signal via JACK. You may fill the\nrack with effects from more than 25 built-in modules spanning\nfrom a simple noise-gate to brain-slashing modulation-fx like\nflanger, phaser or auto-wah. Your signal is processed with\nminimum latency. On any properly set-up Linux-system you do not\nneed to wait for more than 10 milli-seconds for your playing to\nbe delivered, processed by guitarix.\n\n  guitarix offers the range of sounds you would expect from a\nfull-featured universal guitar-amp. You can get crisp\nclean-sounds, nice overdrive, fat distortion and a diversity of\ncrazy sounds never heard before.\n","versionString":"0.33.0","homepage":"http://guitarix.sourceforge.net/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0+"},"versionNumberList":[0,33,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["guitarix"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/guitarix/default.nix:43","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
