{"frozen":{"name":"libevent","shortDescription":"libevent, an event notification library","longDescription":"The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function\n        when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout\n        has been reached.  Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due\n        to signals or regular timeouts.\n\n        libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven\n        network servers.  An application just needs to call event_dispatch()\n        and then add or remove events dynamically without having to change\n        the event loop.\n","versionString":"1.4.14b","license":"mBSD","versionNumberList":[1,4,14,"b"]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["libevent14"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/libevent/1.4.nix:13","date":"2015-08-08"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["libevent14"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}]}}
