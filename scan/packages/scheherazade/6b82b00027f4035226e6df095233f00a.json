This simplified style is often preferred for clarity,\nespecially in non-Arabic languages, but may not be considered appropriate\nin situations where a more elaborate style of calligraphy is preferred.\n\nThis package contains the regular and bold styles for the Scheherazade\nfont family, along with documentation.\n","versionString":"2.100","homepage":"https://software.sil.org/scheherazade/","license":{"fullName":"SIL Open Font License 1.1","shortName":"ofl","spdxId":"OFL-1.1","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/OFL-1.1.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,100]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["scheherazade"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/data/fonts/scheherazade/default.nix:22","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
