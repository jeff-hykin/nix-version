{"frozen":{"name":"autojump","shortDescription":"Autojump, a `cd' command that learns","longDescription":"One of the most used shell commands is “cd”.  A quick survey\namong my friends revealed that between 10 and 20% of all\ncommands they type are actually cd commands! Unfortunately,\njumping from one part of your system to another with cd\nrequires to enter almost the full path, which isn’t very\npractical and requires a lot of keystrokes.\n\nAutojump is a faster way to navigate your filesystem.  It\nworks by maintaining a database of the directories you use the\nmost from the command line.  The jstat command shows you the\ncurrent contents of the database.  You need to work a little\nbit before the database becomes useable.  Once your database\nis reasonably complete, you can “jump” to a directory by\ntyping \"j dirspec\", where dirspec is a few characters of the\ndirectory you want to jump to.  It will jump to the most used\ndirectory whose name matches the pattern given in dirspec.\n\nAutojump supports tab-completion.\n","versionString":"21.5.8","homepage":"http://wiki.github.com/joelthelion/autojump","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License version 3 only","shortName":"GPLv3","url":"http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html"},"versionNumberList":[21,5,8]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["autojump"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","powerpc-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
