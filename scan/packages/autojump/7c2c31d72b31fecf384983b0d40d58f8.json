{"frozen":{"name":"autojump","shortDescription":"A `cd' command that learns","longDescription":"One of the most used shell commands is “cd”.  A quick survey\namong my friends revealed that between 10 and 20% of all\ncommands they type are actually cd commands! Unfortunately,\njumping from one part of your system to another with cd\nrequires to enter almost the full path, which isn’t very\npractical and requires a lot of keystrokes.\n\nAutojump is a faster way to navigate your filesystem.  It\nworks by maintaining a database of the directories you use the\nmost from the command line.  The jstat command shows you the\ncurrent contents of the database.  You need to work a little\nbit before the database becomes usable.  Once your database\nis reasonably complete, you can “jump” to a directory by\ntyping \"j dirspec\", where dirspec is a few characters of the\ndirectory you want to jump to.  It will jump to the most used\ndirectory whose name matches the pattern given in dirspec.\n\nAutojump supports tab-completion.\n","versionString":"22.5.3","homepage":"https://github.com/wting/autojump","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 only","shortName":"gpl3","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[22,5,3]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["autojump"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/autojump/default.nix:27","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-windows","i686-windows","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","arm-none","armv6l-none","aarch64-none","avr-none","i686-none","x86_64-none","powerpc-none","msp430-none","riscv64-none","riscv32-none","vc4-none","js-ghcjs","aarch64-genode","x86_64-genode"]}}
