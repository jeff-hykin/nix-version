{"frozen":{"name":"autojump","shortDescription":"A `cd' command that learns","longDescription":"One of the most used shell commands is “cd”.  A quick survey\namong my friends revealed that between 10 and 20% of all\ncommands they type are actually cd commands! Unfortunately,\njumping from one part of your system to another with cd\nrequires to enter almost the full path, which isn’t very\npractical and requires a lot of keystrokes.\n\nAutojump is a faster way to navigate your filesystem.  It\nworks by maintaining a database of the directories you use the\nmost from the command line.  The jstat command shows you the\ncurrent contents of the database.  You need to work a little\nbit before the database becomes usable.  Once your database\nis reasonably complete, you can “jump” to a directory by\ntyping \"j dirspec\", where dirspec is a few characters of the\ndirectory you want to jump to.  It will jump to the most used\ndirectory whose name matches the pattern given in dirspec.\n\nAutojump supports tab-completion.\n","versionString":"22.5.1","homepage":"http://wiki.github.com/wting/autojump","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 only","shortName":"gpl3","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[22,5,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["autojump"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/autojump/default.nix:27","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
