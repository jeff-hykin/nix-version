{"frozen":{"name":"autojump","shortDescription":"A `cd' command that learns","longDescription":"One of the most used shell commands is “cd”.  A quick survey\namong my friends revealed that between 10 and 20% of all\ncommands they type are actually cd commands! Unfortunately,\njumping from one part of your system to another with cd\nrequires to enter almost the full path, which isn’t very\npractical and requires a lot of keystrokes.\n\nAutojump is a faster way to navigate your filesystem.  It\nworks by maintaining a database of the directories you use the\nmost from the command line.  The jstat command shows you the\ncurrent contents of the database.  You need to work a little\nbit before the database becomes usable.  Once your database\nis reasonably complete, you can “jump” to a directory by\ntyping \"j dirspec\", where dirspec is a few characters of the\ndirectory you want to jump to.  It will jump to the most used\ndirectory whose name matches the pattern given in dirspec.\n\nAutojump supports tab-completion.\n","versionString":"22.2.4","homepage":"http://wiki.github.com/joelthelion/autojump","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 only","shortName":"gpl3","spdxId":"GPL-3.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0"},"versionNumberList":[22,2,4]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["autojump"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/autojump/default.nix:31","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
