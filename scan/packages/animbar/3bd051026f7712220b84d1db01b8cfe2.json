{"frozen":{"name":"animbar","shortDescription":"Create your own animation on paper and transparancy","longDescription":"\tAnimbar lets you easily create your own animation on paper and\n\ttransparancy. From a set of input images two output images are\n\tcomputed, that are printed one on paper and one on\n\ttransparency. By moving the transparency over the paper you\n\tcreate a fascinating animation effect. This kind of animation\n\ttechnique is hundreds of years old and known under several\n\tnames: picket fence animation, barrier grid animation, Moir√©\n\tanimation, to name a few.\n","versionString":"1.2","homepage":"http://animbar.mnim.org","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 only","shortName":"gpl3","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["animbar"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/graphics/animbar/default.nix:23","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
