{"frozen":{"name":"pekwm","shortDescription":"A lightweight window manager","longDescription":"pekwm is a window manager that once upon a time was based on the\naewm++ window manager, but it has evolved enough that it no\nlonger resembles aewm++ at all. It has a much expanded\nfeature-set, including window grouping (similar to ion, pwm, or\nfluxbox), autoproperties, xinerama, keygrabber that supports\nkeychains, and much more.      \n- Lightweight and Unobtrusive, a window manager shouldn't be\n  noticed.\n- Very configurable, we all work and think in different ways.\n- Automatic properties, for all the lazy people, make things\n  appear as they should when starting applications.\n- Chainable Keygrabber, usability for everyone.\n","versionString":"0.1.17","homepage":"http://www.pekwm.org","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,1,17]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["pekwm"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/window-managers/pekwm/default.nix:20","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
