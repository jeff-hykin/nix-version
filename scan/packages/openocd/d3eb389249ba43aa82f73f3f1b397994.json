Several\nnetwork interfaces are available for interactiving with OpenOCD: HTTP,\ntelnet, TCL, and GDB.  The GDB server enables OpenOCD to function as a\n\"remote target\" for source-level debugging of embedded systems using the\nGNU GDB program.\n","versionString":"0.8.0","homepage":"http://openocd.sourceforge.net/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0+"},"versionNumberList":[0,8,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["openocd"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/misc/openocd/default.nix:37","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
