{"frozen":{"name":"openocd","shortDescription":"OpenOCD, an on-chip debugger","longDescription":"OpenOCD provides on-chip programming and debugging support with a\n        layered architecture of JTAG interface and TAP support, debug target\n        support (e.g. ARM, MIPS), and flash chip drivers (e.g. CFI, NAND,\n        etc.).  Several network interfaces are available for interactiving\n        with OpenOCD: HTTP, telnet, TCL, and GDB.  The GDB server enables\n        OpenOCD to function as a \"remote target\" for source-level debugging\n        of embedded systems using the GNU GDB program.\n","versionString":"0.7.0","homepage":"http://openocd.sourceforge.net/","license":"GPLv2+","versionNumberList":[0,7,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["openocd"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
