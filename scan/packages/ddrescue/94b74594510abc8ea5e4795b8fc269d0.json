{"frozen":{"name":"ddrescue","shortDescription":"GNU ddrescue, a data recovery tool","longDescription":"GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool.  It copies data from one file\n        or block device (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying hard to\n        rescue data in case of read errors.\n\n        The basic operation of ddrescue is fully automatic.  That is, you\n        don't have to wait for an error, stop the program, read the log, run\n        it in reverse mode, etc.\n\n        If you use the logfile feature of ddrescue, the data is rescued very\n        efficiently (only the needed blocks are read).  Also you can\n        interrupt the rescue at any time and resume it later at the same\n        point.\n\n        Automatic merging of backups: If you have two or more damaged copies\n        of a file, cdrom, etc, and run ddrescue on all of them, one at a\n        time, with the same output file, you will probably obtain a complete\n        and error-free file.  This is so because the probability of having\n        damaged areas at the same places on different input files is very\n        low.  Using the logfile, only the needed blocks are read from the\n        second and successive copies.\n","versionString":"1.19","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/ddrescue.html","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0+"},"versionNumberList":[1,19]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["ddrescue"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/system/ddrescue/default.nix:16","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
