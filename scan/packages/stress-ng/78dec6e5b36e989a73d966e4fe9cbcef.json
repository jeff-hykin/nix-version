{"frozen":{"name":"stress-ng","shortDescription":"Stress test a computer system","longDescription":"stress-ng will stress test a computer system in various selectable ways. It\nwas designed to exercise various physical subsystems of a computer as well as\nthe various operating system kernel interfaces. Stress-ng features:\n\n  * over 210 stress tests\n  * over 50 CPU specific stress tests that exercise floating point, integer,\n    bit manipulation and control flow\n  * over 20 virtual memory stress tests\n  * portable: builds on Linux, Solaris, *BSD, Minix, Android, MacOS X,\n    Debian Hurd, Haiku, Windows Subsystem for Linux and SunOs/Dilos with\n    gcc, clang, tcc and pcc.\n\nstress-ng was originally intended to make a machine work hard and trip hardware\nissues such as thermal overruns as well as operating system bugs that only\noccur when a system is being thrashed hard. Use stress-ng with caution as some\nof the tests can make a system run hot on poorly designed hardware and also can\ncause excessive system thrashing which may be difficult to stop.\n\nstress-ng can also measure test throughput rates; this can be useful to observe\nperformance changes across different operating system releases or types of\nhardware. However, it has never been intended to be used as a precise benchmark\ntest suite, so do NOT use it in this manner.\n","versionString":"0.11.19","homepage":"https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~cking/stress-ng/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,11,19]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["stress-ng"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/system/stress-ng/default.nix:40","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
