{"frozen":{"name":"picoc","shortDescription":"Very small C interpreter for scripting","longDescription":"PicoC is a very small C interpreter for scripting. It was originally\nwritten as a script language for a UAV's on-board flight system. It's\nalso very suitable for other robotic, embedded and non-embedded\napplications. The core C source code is around 3500 lines of code. It's\nnot intended to be a complete implementation of ISO C but it has all the\nessentials. When compiled it only takes a few k of code space and is also\nvery sparing of data space. This means it can work well in small embedded\ndevices.\n","versionString":"2015-05-04","homepage":"https://github.com/zsaleeba/picoc","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["picoc"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/interpreters/picoc/default.nix:35","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
