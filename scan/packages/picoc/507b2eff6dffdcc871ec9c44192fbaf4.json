{"frozen":{"name":"picoc","shortDescription":"Very small C interpreter for scripting","longDescription":"PicoC is a very small C interpreter for scripting. It was originally\nwritten as a script language for a UAV's on-board flight system. It's\nalso very suitable for other robotic, embedded and non-embedded\napplications. The core C source code is around 3500 lines of code. It's\nnot intended to be a complete implementation of ISO C but it has all the\nessentials. When compiled it only takes a few k of code space and is also\nvery sparing of data space. This means it can work well in small embedded\ndevices.\n","versionString":"2015-05-04","homepage":"https://github.com/zsaleeba/picoc","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["picoc"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/development/interpreters/picoc/default.nix:35","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["picoc"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/interpreters/picoc/default.nix:35","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
