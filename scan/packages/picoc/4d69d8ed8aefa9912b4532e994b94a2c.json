{"frozen":{"name":"picoc","shortDescription":"Very small C interpreter for scripting","longDescription":"PicoC is a very small C interpreter for scripting. It was originally\nwritten as a script language for a UAV's on-board flight system. It's\nalso very suitable for other robotic, embedded and non-embedded\napplications. The core C source code is around 3500 lines of code. It's\nnot intended to be a complete implementation of ISO C but it has all the\nessentials. When compiled it only takes a few k of code space and is also\nvery sparing of data space. This means it can work well in small embedded\ndevices.\n","versionString":"2015-05-04","homepage":"https://github.com/zsaleeba/picoc","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["picoc"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/interpreters/picoc/default.nix:16","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
