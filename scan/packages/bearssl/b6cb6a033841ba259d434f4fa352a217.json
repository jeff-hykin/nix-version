{"frozen":{"name":"bearssl","shortDescription":"An implementation of the SSL/TLS protocol written in C","longDescription":"BearSSL is an implementation of the SSL/TLS protocol (RFC 5246)\nwritten in C. It aims at offering the following features:\n\n* Be correct and secure. In particular, insecure protocol versions and\n  choices of algorithms are not supported, by design; cryptographic\n  algorithm implementations are constant-time by default.\n\n* Be small, both in RAM and code footprint. For instance, a minimal\n  server implementation may fit in about 20 kilobytes of compiled code\n  and 25 kilobytes of RAM.\n\n* Be highly portable. BearSSL targets not only “big” operating systems\n  like Linux and Windows, but also small embedded systems and even\n  special contexts like bootstrap code.\n\n* Be feature-rich and extensible. SSL/TLS has many defined cipher\n  suites and extensions; BearSSL should implement most of them, and\n  allow extra algorithm implementations to be added afterwards,\n  possibly from third parties.\n","versionString":"0.6","homepage":"https://www.bearssl.org/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"MIT License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,6]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["bearssl"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/bearssl/default.nix:35","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["bearssl"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/bearssl/default.nix:35","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","aarch64-genode","i686-genode","x86_64-genode","x86_64-solaris","js-ghcjs","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","mmix-mmixware","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","aarch64-none","arm-none","armv6l-none","avr-none","i686-none","msp430-none","or1k-none","m68k-none","powerpc-none","riscv32-none","riscv64-none","s390-none","s390x-none","vc4-none","x86_64-none","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","x86_64-windows","i686-windows"]}}
