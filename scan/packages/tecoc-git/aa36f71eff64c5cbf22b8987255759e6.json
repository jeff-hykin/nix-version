{"frozen":{"name":"tecoc-git","shortDescription":"A clone of the good old TECO editor","longDescription":"For those who don't know: TECO is the acronym of Tape Editor and COrrector\n(because it was a paper tape edition tool in its debut days). Now the\nacronym follows after Text Editor and Corrector, or Text Editor\nCharacter-Oriented.\n\nTECO is a character-oriented text editor, originally developed by Dan\nMurphy at MIT circa 1962. It is also a Turing-complete imperative\ninterpreted programming language for text manipulation, done via\nuser-loaded sets of macros. In fact, the venerable Emacs was born as a set\nof Editor MACroS for TECO.\n\nTECOC is a portable C implementation of TECO-11.\n","versionString":"20150606","homepage":"https://github.com/blakemcbride/TECOC","license":{"url":"https://github.com/blakemcbride/TECOC/tree/master/doc/readme-1st.txt"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["tecoc"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/editors/tecoc/default.nix:43","date":"2019-03-01"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["tecoc"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/editors/tecoc/default.nix:43","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"families":{"bsd":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"bsd"}}}},{"kernel":{"families":{"darwin":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"darwin"}}}},{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}},{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"solaris"}},{"abi":{"_type":"abi","name":"cygnus"},"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"pe"},"families":{},"name":"windows"}}]}}
