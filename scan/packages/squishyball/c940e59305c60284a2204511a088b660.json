{"frozen":{"name":"squishyball","shortDescription":"A tool to perform sample comparison testing on the command line","longDescription":"squishyball is a simple command-line utility for performing\ndouble-blind A/B, A/B/X or X/X/Y testing on the command line.\nThe user specifies two input files to be compared and uses the\nkeyboard during playback to flip between the randomized samples\nto perform on-the-fly compar‚Äê isons.  After a predetermined\nnumber of trials, squishyball prints the trial results to\nstdout and exits.  Results (stdout) may be redirected to a file\nwithout affecting interactive use of the terminal.\n\nsquishyball can also be used to perform casual, non-randomized\ncomparisons of groups of up to ten samples; this is the default\nmode of operation.\n","versionString":"19580","homepage":"https://svn.xiph.org/trunk/squishyball","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["squishyball"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/squishyball/default.nix:30","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["squishyball"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/squishyball/default.nix:30","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
