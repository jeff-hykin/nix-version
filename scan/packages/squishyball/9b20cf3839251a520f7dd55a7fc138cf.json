{"frozen":{"name":"squishyball","shortDescription":"A tool to perform sample comparison testing on the command line","longDescription":"squishyball is a simple command-line utility for performing\ndouble-blind A/B, A/B/X or X/X/Y testing on the command line.\nThe user specifies two input files to be compared and uses the\nkeyboard during playback to flip between the randomized samples\nto perform on-the-fly compar‚Äê isons.  After a predetermined\nnumber of trials, squishyball prints the trial results to\nstdout and exits.  Results (stdout) may be redirected to a file\nwithout affecting interactive use of the terminal.\n\nsquishyball can also be used to perform casual, non-randomized\ncomparisons of groups of up to ten samples; this is the default\nmode of operation.\n","versionString":"19580","homepage":"https://svn.xiph.org/trunk/squishyball","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["squishyball"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/squishyball/default.nix:30","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
