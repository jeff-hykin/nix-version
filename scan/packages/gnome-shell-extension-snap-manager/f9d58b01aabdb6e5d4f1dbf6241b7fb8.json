Update notification at session start-up.\n\n All the results of actions are displayed in GNOME Terminal, so you can exactly know what you are doing and what is processing. Very light extension, no background process, no periodic background task. You can turn off refresh check and associated notifications (just a variable to toggle in <extension_folder>/extension.js). You can disable auto updates for a limited time (up to one month, renewable), consequently be notified of snap updates and manually install them. \n\n This is not an official Ubuntu/Canonical extension.","versionString":"35","homepage":"https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3715/snap-manager/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["gnomeExtensions","snap-manager"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/desktops/gnome/extensions/buildGnomeExtension.nix:47","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["gnomeExtensions","snap-manager"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/desktops/gnome/extensions/buildGnomeExtension.nix:47","date":"2022-01-31"}]}}
