{"frozen":{"name":"soundmodem","shortDescription":"Audio based modem for ham radio supporting ax.25","longDescription":"This software allows a standard PC soundcard to be used as a packet radio \"modem\". The whole processing is done on the main processor CPU.\nUnlike previous packet radio modem software, this new release offers several new benefits:\n  - Now uses standard operating system sound drivers (OSS/Free under Linux, /dev/audio under Solaris and DirectSound under Windows), thus runs on all soundcards for which drivers for the desired operating system are available.\n  - No fixed relationship between bitrate, sampling rate, and modem parameters. Modems may be parametrized, and multiple modems may even run on the same audio channel!\n  - Usermode solution allows the use of MMX, VIS, Floating point and other media instruction sets to speed up computation.\n  - Cross platform builds from a single source code provides ubiquitous availability.\n","versionString":"soundmodem","homepage":"http://soundmodem.vk4msl.id.au/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2Only","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["soundmodem"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/radio/soundmodem/default.nix:20","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-windows","i686-windows","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","arm-none","armv6l-none","aarch64-none","avr-none","i686-none","x86_64-none","powerpc-none","msp430-none","riscv64-none","riscv32-none","vc4-none","or1k-none","mmix-mmixware","js-ghcjs","aarch64-genode","i686-genode","x86_64-genode"]}}
