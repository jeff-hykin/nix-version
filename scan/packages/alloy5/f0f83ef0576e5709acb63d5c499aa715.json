An Alloy model is a collection of constraints that describes a set\nof structures, e.g. all the possible security configurations of a web\napplication, or all the possible topologies of a switching network. The\nAlloy Analyzer is a solver that takes the constraints of a model and\nfinds structures that satisfy them. Structures are displayed graphically,\nand their appearance can be customized for the domain at hand.\n","versionString":"5.0.0.1","homepage":"http://alloytools.org/","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[5,0,0,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["alloy5"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/alloy/default.nix:34","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
