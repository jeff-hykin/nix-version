{"frozen":{"name":"gnome-shell-extension-quick-lang-switch","shortDescription":"Quickly switch keyboard language layout without showing the switcher popup.","longDescription":"Quickly switch keyboard language layout without showing the switcher popup.\n\nThe language switcher popup by default takes ~0.7sec to appear, meaning that roughly 2-4 strokes are lost till the switch completes. This affects heavily users typing languages with non-latin based alphabets (e.g. Greek, Cyrilic, Arabic, Japanese), particularly when writting technical documents.\nThis extension reduces the switching time to 1/10th of a second (on a 2019 PC).","versionString":"4","homepage":"https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4559/quick-lang-switch/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["gnomeExtensions","quick-lang-switch"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/desktops/gnome/extensions/buildGnomeExtension.nix:47","date":"2022-01-31"}]}}
