{"frozen":{"name":"hol_light","shortDescription":"An interactive theorem prover based on Higher-Order Logic.","longDescription":"HOL Light is a computer program to help users prove interesting mathematical\ntheorems completely formally in Higher-Order Logic.  It sets a very exacting\nstandard of correctness, but provides a number of automated tools and\npre-proved mathematical theorems (e.g., about arithmetic, basic set theory and\nreal analysis) to save the user work.  It is also fully programmable, so users\ncan extend it with new theorems and inference rules without compromising its\nsoundness.\n","versionString":"20130324","homepage":"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/","license":{"fullName":"BSD license (2 clause)","shortName":"BSD-2","url":"http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["hol_light"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}]}}
