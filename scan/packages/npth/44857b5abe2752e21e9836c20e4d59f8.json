{"frozen":{"name":"npth","shortDescription":"The New GNU Portable Threads Library","longDescription":"This is a library to provide the GNU Pth API and thus a non-preemptive\nthreads implementation.\n\nIn contrast to GNU Pth is is based on the system's standard threads\nimplementation.  This allows the use of libraries which are not\ncompatible to GNU Pth.  Experience with a Windows Pth emulation showed\nthat this is a solid way to provide a co-routine based framework.\n","versionString":"1.6","homepage":"http://www.gnupg.org","license":{"fullName":"GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 only","shortName":"lgpl3","spdxId":"LGPL-3.0-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,6]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["npth"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/npth/default.nix:14","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
