{"frozen":{"name":"npth","shortDescription":"The New GNU Portable Threads Library","longDescription":"This is a library to provide the GNU Pth API and thus a non-preemptive\nthreads implementation.\n\nIn contrast to GNU Pth is is based on the system's standard threads\nimplementation.  This allows the use of libraries which are not\ncompatible to GNU Pth.  Experience with a Windows Pth emulation showed\nthat this is a solid way to provide a co-routine based framework.\n","versionString":"1.2","homepage":"http://www.gnupg.org","license":{"fullName":"GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 only","shortName":"lgpl3","spdxId":"LGPL-3.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0"},"versionNumberList":[1,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["npth"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/npth/default.nix:12","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
