{"frozen":{"name":"npth","shortDescription":"The New GNU Portable Threads Library","longDescription":"This is a library to provide the GNU Pth API and thus a non-preemptive\nthreads implementation.\n\nIn contrast to GNU Pth is is based on the system's standard threads\nimplementation.  This allows the use of libraries which are not\ncompatible to GNU Pth.  Experience with a Windows Pth emulation showed\nthat this is a solid way to provide a co-routine based framework.\n","versionString":"1.6","homepage":"http://www.gnupg.org","license":{"fullName":"GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 only","shortName":"lgpl3","spdxId":"LGPL-3.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,6]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["npth"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/npth/default.nix:14","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-windows","i686-windows","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","arm-none","armv6l-none","aarch64-none","avr-none","i686-none","x86_64-none","powerpc-none","msp430-none","riscv64-none","riscv32-none","vc4-none","js-ghcjs","aarch64-genode","x86_64-genode"]}}
