{"frozen":{"name":"npth","shortDescription":"The New GNU Portable Threads Library","longDescription":"This is a library to provide the GNU Pth API and thus a non-preemptive\nthreads implementation.\n\nIn contrast to GNU Pth is is based on the system's standard threads\nimplementation.  This allows the use of libraries which are not\ncompatible to GNU Pth.  Experience with a Windows Pth emulation showed\nthat this is a solid way to provide a co-routine based framework.\n","versionString":"0.91","homepage":"http://www.gnupg.org","license":"LGPLv3","versionNumberList":[0,91]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["npth"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","powerpc-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
