A\nfirst service implemented on top of the networking layer\nallows anonymous censorship-resistant file-sharing.  Anonymity\nis provided by making messages originating from a peer\nindistinguishable from messages that the peer is routing.  All\npeers act as routers and use link-encrypted connections with\nstable bandwidth utilization to communicate with each other.\nGNUnet uses a simple, excess-based economic model to allocate\nresources.  Peers in GNUnet monitor each others behavior with\nrespect to resource usage; peers that contribute to the\nnetwork are rewarded with better service.\n","versionString":"27775","homepage":"http://gnunet.org/","license":"GPLv2+","versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["gnunet_svn"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
