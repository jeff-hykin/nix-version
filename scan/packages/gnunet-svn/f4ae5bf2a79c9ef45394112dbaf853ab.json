{"frozen":{"name":"gnunet-svn","shortDescription":"GNUnet, GNU's decentralized anonymous and censorship-resistant P2P framework","longDescription":"GNUnet is a framework for secure peer-to-peer networking that\ndoes not use any centralized or otherwise trusted services.  A\nfirst service implemented on top of the networking layer\nallows anonymous censorship-resistant file-sharing.  Anonymity\nis provided by making messages originating from a peer\nindistinguishable from messages that the peer is routing.  All\npeers act as routers and use link-encrypted connections with\nstable bandwidth utilization to communicate with each other.\nGNUnet uses a simple, excess-based economic model to allocate\nresources.  Peers in GNUnet monitor each others behavior with\nrespect to resource usage; peers that contribute to the\nnetwork are rewarded with better service.\n","versionString":"27840","homepage":"http://gnunet.org/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0+"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["gnunet_svn"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/networking/p2p/gnunet/svn.nix:69","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
