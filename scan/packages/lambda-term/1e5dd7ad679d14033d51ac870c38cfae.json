It provides an abstraction for keys,\nmouse events, colors, as well as a set of widgets to write\ncurses-like applications.\n\nThe main objective of lambda-term is to provide a higher level\nfunctional interface to terminal manipulation than, for example,\nncurses, by providing a native OCaml interface instead of bindings to\na C library.\n\nLambda-term integrates with zed to provide text edition facilities in\nconsole applications.\n","versionString":"1.6","homepage":"https://github.com/diml/lambda-term","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause"},"versionNumberList":[1,6]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["ocamlPackages","lambdaTerm-1_6"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/ocaml-modules/lambda-term/1.6.nix:18","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin"]}}
