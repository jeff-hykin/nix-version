{"frozen":{"name":"p910nd","shortDescription":"Small printer daemon passing jobs directly to the printer","longDescription":"p910nd is a small printer daemon intended for diskless platforms that\ndoes not spool to disk but passes the job directly to the printer.\nNormally a lpr daemon on a spooling host connects to it with a TCP\nconnection on port 910n (where n=0, 1, or 2 for lp0, 1 and 2\nrespectively). p910nd is particularly useful for diskless platforms.\nCommon Unix Printing System (CUPS) supports this protocol, it's called\nthe AppSocket protocol and has the scheme socket://. LPRng also supports\nthis protocol and the syntax is lp=remotehost%9100 in /etc/printcap.\n","versionString":"0.97","homepage":"http://p910nd.sourceforge.net/","license":{"deprecated":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,97]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["p910nd"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/servers/p910nd/default.nix:28","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
