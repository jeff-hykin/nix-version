{"frozen":{"name":"p910nd","shortDescription":"Small printer daemon passing jobs directly to the printer","longDescription":"p910nd is a small printer daemon intended for diskless platforms that\ndoes not spool to disk but passes the job directly to the printer.\nNormally a lpr daemon on a spooling host connects to it with a TCP\nconnection on port 910n (where n=0, 1, or 2 for lp0, 1 and 2\nrespectively). p910nd is particularly useful for diskless platforms.\nCommon Unix Printing System (CUPS) supports this protocol, it's called\nthe AppSocket protocol and has the scheme socket://. LPRng also supports\nthis protocol and the syntax is lp=remotehost%9100 in /etc/printcap.\n","versionString":"0.97","homepage":"http://p910nd.sourceforge.net/","license":{"deprecated":true,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,97]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["p910nd"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/servers/p910nd/default.nix:29","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["p910nd"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/servers/p910nd/default.nix:29","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-solaris","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox"]}}
