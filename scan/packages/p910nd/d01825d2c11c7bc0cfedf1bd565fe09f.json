{"frozen":{"name":"p910nd","shortDescription":"Small printer daemon passing jobs directly to the printer","longDescription":"p910nd is a small printer daemon intended for diskless platforms that\ndoes not spool to disk but passes the job directly to the printer.\nNormally a lpr daemon on a spooling host connects to it with a TCP\nconnection on port 910n (where n=0, 1, or 2 for lp0, 1 and 2\nrespectively). p910nd is particularly useful for diskless platforms.\nCommon Unix Printing System (CUPS) supports this protocol, it's called\nthe AppSocket protocol and has the scheme socket://. LPRng also supports\nthis protocol and the syntax is lp=remotehost%9100 in /etc/printcap.\n","versionString":"0.97","homepage":"http://p910nd.sourceforge.net/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,97]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["p910nd"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/servers/p910nd/default.nix:28","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
