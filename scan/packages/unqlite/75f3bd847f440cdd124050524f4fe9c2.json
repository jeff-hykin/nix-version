{"frozen":{"name":"unqlite","shortDescription":"Self-contained, serverless, zero-conf, transactional NoSQL DB library","longDescription":"UnQLite is a in-process software library which implements a\nself-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional NoSQL\ndatabase engine. UnQLite is a document store database similar to MongoDB,\nRedis, CouchDB etc. as well a standard Key/Value store similar to\nBerkeleyDB, LevelDB, etc.\n\nUnQLite is an embedded NoSQL (Key/Value store and Document-store) database\nengine. Unlike most other NoSQL databases, UnQLite does not have a\nseparate server process. UnQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary\ndisk files. A complete database with multiple collections, is contained in\na single disk file. The database file format is cross-platform, you can\nfreely copy a database between 32-bit and 64-bit systems or between\nbig-endian and little-endian architectures.\n","versionString":"1.1.9","homepage":"https://unqlite.org/","license":{"fullName":"BSD 2-clause \"Simplified\" License","shortName":"bsd2","spdxId":"BSD-2-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,1,9]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["unqlite"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/unqlite/default.nix:20","date":"2021-02-24"}]}}
