{"frozen":{"name":"unqlite","shortDescription":"Self-contained, serverless, zero-conf, transactional NoSQL DB library","longDescription":"UnQLite is a in-process software library which implements a\nself-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional NoSQL\ndatabase engine. UnQLite is a document store database similar to MongoDB,\nRedis, CouchDB etc. as well a standard Key/Value store similar to\nBerkeleyDB, LevelDB, etc.\n\nUnQLite is an embedded NoSQL (Key/Value store and Document-store) database\nengine. Unlike most other NoSQL databases, UnQLite does not have a\nseparate server process. UnQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary\ndisk files. A complete database with multiple collections, is contained in\na single disk file. The database file format is cross-platform, you can\nfreely copy a database between 32-bit and 64-bit systems or between\nbig-endian and little-endian architectures.\n","versionString":"1.1.9","homepage":"https://unqlite.org/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"BSD 2-clause \"Simplified\" License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"bsd2","spdxId":"BSD-2-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,1,9]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["unqlite"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/unqlite/default.nix:20","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["unqlite"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/unqlite/default.nix:20","date":"2022-01-31"}]}}
