{"frozen":{"name":"openal","shortDescription":"Cross-platform 3D audio API","longDescription":"OpenAL is a cross-platform 3D audio API appropriate for use with\ngaming applications and many other types of audio applications.\n\nThe library models a collection of audio sources moving in a 3D\nspace that are heard by a single listener somewhere in that\nspace.  The basic OpenAL objects are a Listener, a Source, and a\nBuffer.  There can be a large number of Buffers, which contain\naudio data.  Each buffer can be attached to one or more Sources,\nwhich represent points in 3D space which are emitting audio.\nThere is always one Listener object (per audio context), which\nrepresents the position where the sources are heard -- rendering\nis done from the perspective of the Listener.\n","versionString":"1.16.0","homepage":"http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0+"},"versionNumberList":[1,16,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["openalLegacy"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/openal/default.nix:15","date":"2015-08-08"}]}}
