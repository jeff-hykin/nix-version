{"frozen":{"name":"kythe","shortDescription":"A pluggable, (mostly) language-agnostic ecosystem for building tools that work with code.","longDescription":"The Kythe project was founded to provide and support tools and standards\n  that encourage interoperability among programs that manipulate source\n  code. At a high level, the main goal of Kythe is to provide a standard,\n  language-agnostic interchange mechanism, allowing tools that operate on\n  source code — including build systems, compilers, interpreters, static\n  analyses, editors, code-review applications, and more — to share\n  information with each other smoothly.
