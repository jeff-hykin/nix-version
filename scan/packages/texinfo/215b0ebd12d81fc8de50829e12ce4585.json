It is used by many non-GNU projects as\nwell.\n\nTexinfo uses a single source file to produce output in a number\nof formats, both online and printed (dvi, html, info, pdf, xml,\netc.).  This means that instead of writing different documents\nfor online information and another for a printed manual, you\nneed write only one document.  And when the work is revised, you\nneed revise only that one document.  The Texinfo system is\nwell-integrated with GNU Emacs.\n","versionString":"4.13a","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/","license":"GPLv3+","versionNumberList":[4,13,"a"]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["texinfo"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}]}}
