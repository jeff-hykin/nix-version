{"frozen":{"name":"tinywm","shortDescription":"A tiny window manger for X11","longDescription":"\nTinyWM is a tiny window manager that I created as an exercise in\nminimalism. It is also maybe helpful in learning some of the very basics\nof creating a window manager. It is only around 50 lines of C. There is\nalso a Python version using python-xlib.\n\nIt lets you do four basic things:\n\n- Move windows interactively with Alt+Button1 drag (left mouse button)\n- Resize windows interactively with Alt+Button3 drag (right mouse button)\n- Raise windows with Alt+F1 (not high on usability I know, but I needed a\n  keybinding in there somewhere)\n- Focus windows with the mouse pointer (X does this on its own)\n","versionString":"2014-04-22","homepage":"http://incise.org/tinywm.html","license":{"fullName":"Public Domain","shortName":"publicDomain"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["tinywm"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/window-managers/tinywm/default.nix:31","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
