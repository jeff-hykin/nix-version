{"frozen":{"name":"zile","shortDescription":"GNU Zile, a lightweight Emacs clone","longDescription":"GNU Zile, which is a lightweight Emacs clone.  Zile is short\nfor Zile Is Lossy Emacs.  Zile has been written to be as\nsimilar as possible to Emacs; every Emacs user should feel at\nhome.\n\nZile has all of Emacs's basic editing features: it is 8-bit\nclean (though it currently lacks Unicode support), and the\nnumber of editing buffers and windows is only limited by\navailable memory and screen space respectively.  Registers,\nminibuffer completion and auto fill are available.  Function\nand variable names are identical with Emacs's (except those\ncontaining the word \"emacs\", which instead contain the word\n\"zile\"!).\n\nHowever, all of this is packed into a program which typically\ncompiles to about 130Kb.\n","versionString":"2.4.9","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/zile/","license":"GPLv3+","versionNumberList":[2,4,9]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["zile"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}]}}
