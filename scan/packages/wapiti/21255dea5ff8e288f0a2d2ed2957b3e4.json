Once it gets the list of URLs,\nforms and their inputs, Wapiti acts like a fuzzer, injecting payloads to see\nif a script is vulnerable.\n","versionString":"3.0.5","homepage":"https://wapiti-scanner.github.io/","license":[{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2Only","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"}],"versionNumberList":[3,0,5]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["wapiti"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/security/wapiti/default.nix:114","date":"2021-10-20"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin"]}}
