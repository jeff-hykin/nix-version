{"frozen":{"name":"python3.7-ply","shortDescription":"PLY (Python Lex-Yacc), an implementation of the lex and yacc parsing tools for Python","longDescription":"PLY is an implementation of lex and yacc parsing tools for Python.\nIn a nutshell, PLY is nothing more than a straightforward lex/yacc\nimplementation.  Here is a list of its essential features: It's\nimplemented entirely in Python; It uses LR-parsing which is\nreasonably efficient and well suited for larger grammars; PLY\nprovides most of the standard lex/yacc features including support for\nempty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support for\nambiguous grammars; PLY is straightforward to use and provides very\nextensive error checking; PLY doesn't try to do anything more or less\nthan provide the basic lex/yacc functionality.  In other words, it's\nnot a large parsing framework or a component of some larger system.\n","versionString":"3.11","homepage":"http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,11]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["python37Packages","ply"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/python-modules/ply/default.nix:26","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}},{"kernel":{"families":{"darwin":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"darwin"}}}}]}}
