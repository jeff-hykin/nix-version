{"frozen":{"name":"pdf-redact-tools","shortDescription":"Redact and strip metadata from documents before publishing","longDescription":"\tPDF Redact Tools helps with securely redacting and stripping metadata\n\tfrom documents before publishing. Note that this is not a security tool.\n        It uses ImageMagick to parse PDFs.  While ImageMagick is a versatile tool, it has\n        a history of several security bugs. A malicious PDF could exploit a bug in\n        ImageMagick to take over your computer. If you're working with potentially\n        malicious PDFs, it's safest to run them through PDF Redact Tools in an isolated\n        environment, such as a virtual machine, or by using a tool such as the Qubes\n        PDF Converter instead.\n","versionString":"0.1.2","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 only","shortName":"gpl3","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,1,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["pdf-redact-tools"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/graphics/pdfredacttools/default.nix:23","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
