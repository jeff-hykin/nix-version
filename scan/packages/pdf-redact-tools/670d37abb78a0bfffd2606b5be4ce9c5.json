{"frozen":{"name":"pdf-redact-tools","shortDescription":"Redact and strip metadata from documents before publishing","longDescription":"\tPDF Redact Tools helps with securely redacting and stripping metadata\n\tfrom documents before publishing. Note that this is not a security tool.\n        It uses ImageMagick to parse PDFs.  While ImageMagick is a versatile tool, it has\n        a history of several security bugs. A malicious PDF could exploit a bug in\n        ImageMagick to take over your computer. If you're working with potentially\n        malicious PDFs, it's safest to run them through PDF Redact Tools in an isolated\n        environment, such as a virtual machine, or by using a tool such as the Qubes\n        PDF Converter instead.\n","versionString":"0.1.2","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 only","shortName":"gpl3","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,1,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["pdf-redact-tools"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/graphics/pdfredacttools/default.nix:23","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-windows","i686-windows","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","arm-none","armv6l-none","aarch64-none","avr-none","i686-none","x86_64-none","powerpc-none","msp430-none","riscv64-none","riscv32-none","vc4-none","js-ghcjs","aarch64-genode","x86_64-genode"]}}
