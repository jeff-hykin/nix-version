{"frozen":{"name":"bfg-repo-cleaner","shortDescription":"Removes large or troublesome blobs in a git repository like git-filter-branch does, but faster","longDescription":"The BFG is a simpler, faster alternative to git-filter-branch for\ncleansing bad data out of your Git repository history, in particular removing\ncrazy big files and removing passwords, credentials, and other private data.\n\nThe git-filter-branch command is enormously powerful and can do things\nthat the BFG can't - but the BFG is much better for the tasks above, because\nit's faster (10-720x), simpler (dedicated to just removing things), and\nbeautiful (can use Scala instead of bash to script customizations).\n","versionString":"1.13.0","homepage":"https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/","license":{"deprecated":true,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl3","spdxId":"GPL-3.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,13,0]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["bfg-repo-cleaner"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/version-management/git-and-tools/bfg-repo-cleaner/default.nix:33","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["bfg-repo-cleaner"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/version-management/git-and-tools/bfg-repo-cleaner/default.nix:33","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-solaris","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox"]}}
