{"frozen":{"name":"bfg-repo-cleaner","shortDescription":"Removes large or troublesome blobs in a git repository like git-filter-branch does, but faster","longDescription":"The BFG is a simpler, faster alternative to git-filter-branch for\ncleansing bad data out of your Git repository history, in particular removing\ncrazy big files and removing passwords, credentials, and other private data.\n\nThe git-filter-branch command is enormously powerful and can do things\nthat the BFG can't - but the BFG is much better for the tasks above, because\nit's faster (10-720x), simpler (dedicated to just removing things), and\nbeautiful (can use Scala instead of bash to script customizations).\n","versionString":"1.13.0","homepage":"https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/","license":{"deprecated":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0","spdxId":"GPL-3.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,13,0]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["bfg-repo-cleaner"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/version-management/git-and-tools/bfg-repo-cleaner/default.nix:32","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
