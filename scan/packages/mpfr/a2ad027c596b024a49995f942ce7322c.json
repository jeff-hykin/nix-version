{"frozen":{"name":"mpfr","shortDescription":"GNU MPFR, a library for multiple-precision floating-point arithmetic","longDescription":"The GNU MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision\nfloating-point computations with correct rounding.  MPFR is\nbased on the GMP multiple-precision library.\n\nThe main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for\nmultiple-precision floating-point computation which is both\nefficient and has a well-defined semantics.  It copies the good\nideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision\nfloating-point arithmetic (53-bit mantissa).\n","versionString":"3.1.0","homepage":"http://www.mpfr.org/","license":"LGPLv2+","versionNumberList":[3,1,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["mpfr"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","powerpc-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
