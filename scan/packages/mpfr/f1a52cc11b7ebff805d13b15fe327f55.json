{"frozen":{"name":"mpfr","shortDescription":"Library for multiple-precision floating-point arithmetic","longDescription":"The GNU MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision\nfloating-point computations with correct rounding.  MPFR is\nbased on the GMP multiple-precision library.\n\nThe main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for\nmultiple-precision floating-point computation which is both\nefficient and has a well-defined semantics.  It copies the good\nideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision\nfloating-point arithmetic (53-bit mantissa).\n","versionString":"4.0.2","homepage":"https://www.mpfr.org/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[4,0,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["mpfr"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/mpfr/default.nix:30","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-windows","i686-windows","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","arm-none","armv6l-none","aarch64-none","avr-none","i686-none","x86_64-none","powerpc-none","msp430-none","riscv64-none","riscv32-none","vc4-none","js-ghcjs","aarch64-genode","x86_64-genode"]}}
