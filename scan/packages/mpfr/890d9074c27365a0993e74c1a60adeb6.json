{"frozen":{"name":"mpfr","shortDescription":"Library for multiple-precision floating-point arithmetic","longDescription":"The GNU MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision\nfloating-point computations with correct rounding.  MPFR is\nbased on the GMP multiple-precision library.\n\nThe main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for\nmultiple-precision floating-point computation which is both\nefficient and has a well-defined semantics.  It copies the good\nideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision\nfloating-point arithmetic (53-bit mantissa).\n","versionString":"4.0.2","homepage":"https://www.mpfr.org/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[4,0,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["mpfr"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/mpfr/default.nix:30","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
