{"frozen":{"name":"mpfr","shortDescription":"Library for multiple-precision floating-point arithmetic","longDescription":"The GNU MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision\nfloating-point computations with correct rounding.  MPFR is\nbased on the GMP multiple-precision library.\n\nThe main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for\nmultiple-precision floating-point computation which is both\nefficient and has a well-defined semantics.  It copies the good\nideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision\nfloating-point arithmetic (53-bit mantissa).\n","versionString":"3.1.3","homepage":"http://www.mpfr.org/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0+"},"versionNumberList":[3,1,3]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["mpfr"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/mpfr/default.nix:25","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
