{"frozen":{"name":"ocaml","shortDescription":"Most popular variant of the Caml language","longDescription":"OCaml is the most popular variant of the Caml language.  From a\nlanguage standpoint, it extends the core Caml language with a\nfully-fledged object-oriented layer, as well as a powerful module\nsystem, all connected by a sound, polymorphic type system featuring\ntype inference.\n\nThe OCaml system is an industrial-strength implementation of this\nlanguage, featuring a high-performance native-code compiler (ocamlopt)\nfor 9 processor architectures (IA32, PowerPC, AMD64, Alpha, Sparc,\nMips, IA64, HPPA, StrongArm), as well as a bytecode compiler (ocamlc)\nand an interactive read-eval-print loop (ocaml) for quick development\nand portability.  The OCaml distribution includes a comprehensive\nstandard library, a replay debugger (ocamldebug), lexer (ocamllex) and\nparser (ocamlyacc) generators, a pre-processor pretty-printer (camlp4)\nand a documentation generator (ocamldoc).\n","versionString":"4.06.1","homepage":"http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml","license":[{"fullName":"Q Public License 1.0","shortName":"qpl","spdxId":"QPL-1.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/QPL-1.0.html"},{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 only","shortName":"lgpl2","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-only.html"}],"versionNumberList":[4,6,1]},"flexible":{"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["ocaml"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/compilers/ocaml/generic.nix:75","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}},{"kernel":{"families":{"darwin":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"darwin"}}}}]}}
