{"frozen":{"name":"ocaml","shortDescription":"Most popular variant of the Caml language","longDescription":"Objective Caml is the most popular variant of the Caml language.\n        From a language standpoint, it extends the core Caml language with a\n        fully-fledged object-oriented layer, as well as a powerful module\n        system, all connected by a sound, polymorphic type system featuring\n        type inference.\n\n        The Objective Caml system is an industrial-strength implementation\n        of this language, featuring a high-performance native-code compiler\n        (ocamlopt) for 9 processor architectures (IA32, PowerPC, AMD64,\n        Alpha, Sparc, Mips, IA64, HPPA, StrongArm), as well as a bytecode\n        compiler (ocamlc) and an interactive read-eval-print loop (ocaml)\n        for quick development and portability.  The Objective Caml\n        distribution includes a comprehensive standard library, a replay\n        debugger (ocamldebug), lexer (ocamllex) and parser (ocamlyacc)\n        generators, a pre-processor pretty-printer (camlp4) and a\n        documentation generator (ocamldoc).\n","versionString":"3.11.2","homepage":"http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml","license":[{"fullName":"Q Public License 1.0","shortName":"qpl","spdxId":"QPL-1.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/QPL-1.0"},{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 only","shortName":"lgpl2","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0"}],"versionNumberList":[3,11,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["ocaml_3_11_2"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/compilers/ocaml/3.11.2.nix:50","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin"]}}
