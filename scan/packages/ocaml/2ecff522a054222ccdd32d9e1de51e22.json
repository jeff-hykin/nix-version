{"frozen":{"name":"ocaml","shortDescription":"Most popular variant of the Caml language","longDescription":"OCaml is the most popular variant of the Caml language.  From a\nlanguage standpoint, it extends the core Caml language with a\nfully-fledged object-oriented layer, as well as a powerful module\nsystem, all connected by a sound, polymorphic type system featuring\ntype inference.\n\nThe OCaml system is an industrial-strength implementation of this\nlanguage, featuring a high-performance native-code compiler (ocamlopt)\nfor 9 processor architectures (IA32, PowerPC, AMD64, Alpha, Sparc,\nMips, IA64, HPPA, StrongArm), as well as a bytecode compiler (ocamlc)\nand an interactive read-eval-print loop (ocaml) for quick development\nand portability.  The OCaml distribution includes a comprehensive\nstandard library, a replay debugger (ocamldebug), lexer (ocamllex) and\nparser (ocamlyacc) generators, a pre-processor pretty-printer (camlp4)\nand a documentation generator (ocamldoc).\n","versionString":"4.00.1","homepage":"http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml","license":[{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"Q Public License 1.0","redistributable":true,"shortName":"qpl","spdxId":"QPL-1.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/QPL-1.0.html"},{"deprecated":true,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2","redistributable":true,"shortName":"lgpl2","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0.html"}],"versionNumberList":[4,0,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["ocaml_4_00_1"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/development/compilers/ocaml/4.00.1.nix:43","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["ocaml_4_00_1"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/compilers/ocaml/4.00.1.nix:43","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
