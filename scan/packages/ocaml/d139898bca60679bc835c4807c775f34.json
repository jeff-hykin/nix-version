{"frozen":{"name":"ocaml","shortDescription":"Most popular variant of the Caml language","longDescription":"OCaml is the most popular variant of the Caml language.  From a\nlanguage standpoint, it extends the core Caml language with a\nfully-fledged object-oriented layer, as well as a powerful module\nsystem, all connected by a sound, polymorphic type system featuring\ntype inference.\n\nThe OCaml system is an industrial-strength implementation of this\nlanguage, featuring a high-performance native-code compiler (ocamlopt)\nfor 9 processor architectures (IA32, PowerPC, AMD64, Alpha, Sparc,\nMips, IA64, HPPA, StrongArm), as well as a bytecode compiler (ocamlc)\nand an interactive read-eval-print loop (ocaml) for quick development\nand portability.  The OCaml distribution includes a comprehensive\nstandard library, a replay debugger (ocamldebug), lexer (ocamllex) and\nparser (ocamlyacc) generators, a pre-processor pretty-printer (camlp4)\nand a documentation generator (ocamldoc).\n","versionString":"4.01.0","homepage":"http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml","license":[{"fullName":"Q Public License 1.0","shortName":"qpl","spdxId":"QPL-1.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/QPL-1.0"},{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 only","shortName":"lgpl2","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0"}],"versionNumberList":[4,1,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["ocaml"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/compilers/ocaml/4.01.0.nix:58","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin"]}}
