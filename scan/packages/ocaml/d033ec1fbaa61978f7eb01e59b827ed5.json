{"frozen":{"name":"ocaml","shortDescription":"Objective Caml, the most popular variant of the Caml language","longDescription":"Objective Caml is the most popular variant of the Caml language.\n        From a language standpoint, it extends the core Caml language with a\n        fully-fledged object-oriented layer, as well as a powerful module\n        system, all connected by a sound, polymorphic type system featuring\n        type inference.\n\n        The Objective Caml system is an industrial-strength implementation\n        of this language, featuring a high-performance native-code compiler\n        (ocamlopt) for 9 processor architectures (IA32, PowerPC, AMD64,\n        Alpha, Sparc, Mips, IA64, HPPA, StrongArm), as well as a bytecode\n        compiler (ocamlc) and an interactive read-eval-print loop (ocaml)\n        for quick development and portability.  The Objective Caml\n        distribution includes a comprehensive standard library, a replay\n        debugger (ocamldebug), lexer (ocamllex) and parser (ocamlyacc)\n        generators, a pre-processor pretty-printer (camlp4) and a\n        documentation generator (ocamldoc).\n","versionString":"3.11.2","homepage":"http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml","versionNumberList":[3,11,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["ocaml_3_11_2"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin"]}}
