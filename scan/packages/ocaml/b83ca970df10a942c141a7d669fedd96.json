{"frozen":{"name":"ocaml","shortDescription":"Most popular variant of the Caml language","longDescription":"OCaml is the most popular variant of the Caml language.  From a\nlanguage standpoint, it extends the core Caml language with a\nfully-fledged object-oriented layer, as well as a powerful module\nsystem, all connected by a sound, polymorphic type system featuring\ntype inference.\n\nThe OCaml system is an industrial-strength implementation of this\nlanguage, featuring a high-performance native-code compiler (ocamlopt)\nfor 9 processor architectures (IA32, PowerPC, AMD64, Alpha, Sparc,\nMips, IA64, HPPA, StrongArm), as well as a bytecode compiler (ocamlc)\nand an interactive read-eval-print loop (ocaml) for quick development\nand portability.  The OCaml distribution includes a comprehensive\nstandard library, a replay debugger (ocamldebug), lexer (ocamllex) and\nparser (ocamlyacc) generators, a pre-processor pretty-printer (camlp4)\nand a documentation generator (ocamldoc).\n","versionString":"4.03.0","homepage":"http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml","license":[{"fullName":"Q Public License 1.0","shortName":"qpl","spdxId":"QPL-1.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/QPL-1.0.html"},{"deprecated":true,"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0.html"}],"versionNumberList":[4,3,0]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["ocaml_4_03"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/compilers/ocaml/generic.nix:86","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin"]}}
