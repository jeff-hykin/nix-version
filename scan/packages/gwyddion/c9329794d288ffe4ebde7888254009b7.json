{"frozen":{"name":"gwyddion","shortDescription":"Scanning probe microscopy data visualization and analysis","longDescription":"A modular program for SPM (scanning probe microscopy) data\nvisualization and analysis. Primarily it is intended for the\nanalysis of height fields obtained by scanning probe microscopy\ntechniques (AFM, MFM, STM, SNOM/NSOM) and it supports a lot of\nSPM data formats. However, it can be used for general height\nfield and (greyscale) image processing, for instance for the\nanalysis of profilometry data or thickness maps from imaging\nspectrophotometry.\n","versionString":"2.48","homepage":"http://gwyddion.net/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,48]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["gwyddion"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/chemistry/gwyddion/default.nix:17","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
