{"frozen":{"name":"gwyddion","shortDescription":"Scanning probe microscopy data visualization and analysis","longDescription":"A modular program for SPM (scanning probe microscopy) data\nvisualization and analysis. Primarily it is intended for the\nanalysis of height fields obtained by scanning probe microscopy\ntechniques (AFM, MFM, STM, SNOM/NSOM) and it supports a lot of\nSPM data formats. However, it can be used for general height\nfield and (greyscale) image processing, for instance for the\nanalysis of profilometry data or thickness maps from imaging\nspectrophotometry.\n","versionString":"2.56","homepage":"http://gwyddion.net/","license":{"deprecated":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,56]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["gwyddion"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/chemistry/gwyddion/default.nix:70","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin"]}}
