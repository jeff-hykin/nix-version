{"frozen":{"name":"gwyddion","shortDescription":"Scanning probe microscopy data visualization and analysis","longDescription":"A modular program for SPM (scanning probe microscopy) data\nvisualization and analysis. Primarily it is intended for the\nanalysis of height fields obtained by scanning probe microscopy\ntechniques (AFM, MFM, STM, SNOM/NSOM) and it supports a lot of\nSPM data formats. However, it can be used for general height\nfield and (greyscale) image processing, for instance for the\nanalysis of profilometry data or thickness maps from imaging\nspectrophotometry.\n","versionString":"2.60","homepage":"http://gwyddion.net/","license":{"deprecated":true,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,60]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["gwyddion"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/chemistry/gwyddion/default.nix:70","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin"]}}
