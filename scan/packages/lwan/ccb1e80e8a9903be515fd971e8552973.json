{"frozen":{"name":"lwan","shortDescription":"Lightweight high-performance multi-threaded web server","longDescription":"A lightweight and speedy web server with a low memory\n      footprint (~500KiB for 10k idle connections), with minimal system calls and\n      memory allocation.  Lwan contains a hand-crafted HTTP request parser. Files are\n      served using the most efficient way according to their size: no copies between\n      kernel and userland for files larger than 16KiB.  Smaller files are sent using\n      vectored I/O of memory-mapped buffers. Header overhead is considered before\n      compressing small files.  Features include: mustache templating engine and IPv6\n      support.\n    ","versionString":"0.3","homepage":"https://lwan.ws/","license":{"deprecated":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,3]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["lwan"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/servers/http/lwan/default.nix:19","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
