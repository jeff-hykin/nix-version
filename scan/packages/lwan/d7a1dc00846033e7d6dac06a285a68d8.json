{"frozen":{"name":"lwan","shortDescription":"Lightweight high-performance multi-threaded web server","longDescription":"A lightweight and speedy web server with a low memory\n      footprint (~500KiB for 10k idle connections), with minimal system calls and\n      memory allocation.  Lwan contains a hand-crafted HTTP request parser. Files are\n      served using the most efficient way according to their size: no copies between\n      kernel and userland for files larger than 16KiB.  Smaller files are sent using\n      vectored I/O of memory-mapped buffers. Header overhead is considered before\n      compressing small files.  Features include: mustache templating engine and IPv6\n      support.\n    ","versionString":"0.1","homepage":"https://lwan.ws/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["lwan"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/servers/http/lwan/default.nix:20","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
