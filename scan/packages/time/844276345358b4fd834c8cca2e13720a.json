You can select\nwhich information is reported and the format in which it is\nshown, or have `time' save the information in a file instead of\ndisplaying it on the screen.\n\nThe resources that `time' can report on fall into the general\ncategories of time, memory, and I/O and IPC calls.  Some systems\ndo not provide much information about program resource use;\n`time' reports unavailable information as zero values.\n","versionString":"1.7","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/time/","license":"GPLv2+","versionNumberList":[1,7]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["time"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}]}}
