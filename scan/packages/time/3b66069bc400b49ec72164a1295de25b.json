You can select\nwhich information is reported and the format in which it is\nshown, or have `time' save the information in a file instead of\ndisplaying it on the screen.\n\nThe resources that `time' can report on fall into the general\ncategories of time, memory, and I/O and IPC calls.  Some systems\ndo not provide much information about program resource use;\n`time' reports unavailable information as zero values.\n","versionString":"1.7","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/time/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0+"},"versionNumberList":[1,7]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["time"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/time/default.nix:14","date":"2015-08-08"}]}}
