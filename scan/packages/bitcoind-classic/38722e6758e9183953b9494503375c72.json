{"frozen":{"name":"bitcoind-classic","shortDescription":"Peer-to-peer electronic cash system (Classic client)","longDescription":"Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is\ncompletely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted\nparties. Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly\nwith each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.\n\nBitcoin Classic stands for the original Bitcoin as Satoshi described it,\n\"A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\". We are writing the software that\nminers and users say they want. We will make sure it solves their needs, help\nthem deploy it, and gracefully upgrade the bitcoin network's capacity\ntogether. The data shows that Bitcoin can grow, on-chain, to welcome many\nmore users onto our coin in a safe and distributed manner. In the future we\nwill continue to release updates that are in line with Satoshiâ€™s whitepaper &\nvision, and are agreed upon by the community.\n","versionString":"1.3.8","homepage":"https://bitcoinclassic.com/","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,3,8]},"flexible":{"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["bitcoind-classic"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/blockchains/bitcoin-classic.nix:32","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
