{"frozen":{"name":"profile-sync-daemon","shortDescription":"Syncs browser profile dirs to RAM","longDescription":"Profile-sync-daemon (psd) is a tiny pseudo-daemon designed to manage your\nbrowser's profile in tmpfs and to periodically sync it back to your\nphysical disc (HDD/SSD). This is accomplished via a symlinking step and\nan innovative use of rsync to maintain back-up and synchronization\nbetween the two. One of the major design goals of psd is a completely\ntransparent user experience.\n","versionString":"6.42","homepage":"https://github.com/graysky2/profile-sync-daemon","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[6,42]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["profile-sync-daemon"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/profile-sync-daemon/default.nix:27","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
