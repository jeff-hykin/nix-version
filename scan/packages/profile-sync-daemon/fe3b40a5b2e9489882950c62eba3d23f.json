This is accomplished via a symlinking step and\nan innovative use of rsync to maintain back-up and synchronization\nbetween the two. One of the major design goals of psd is a completely\ntransparent user experience.\n","versionString":"6.34","homepage":"https://github.com/graysky2/profile-sync-daemon","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[6,34]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["profile-sync-daemon"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/profile-sync-daemon/default.nix:26","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
