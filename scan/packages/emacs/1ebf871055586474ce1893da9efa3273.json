{"frozen":{"name":"emacs","shortDescription":"GNU Emacs 24, the extensible, customizable text editor","longDescription":"GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editorâ€”and more.  At its\ncore is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp\nprogramming language with extensions to support text editing.\n\nThe features of GNU Emacs include: content-sensitive editing modes,\nincluding syntax coloring, for a wide variety of file types including\nplain text, source code, and HTML; complete built-in documentation,\nincluding a tutorial for new users; full Unicode support for nearly all\nhuman languages and their scripts; highly customizable, using Emacs\nLisp code or a graphical interface; a large number of extensions that\nadd other functionality, including a project planner, mail and news\nreader, debugger interface, calendar, and more.  Many of these\nextensions are distributed with GNU Emacs; others are available\nseparately.\n\nThis is \"Mac port\" addition to GNU Emacs 24. This provides a native\nGUI support for Mac OS X 10.4 - 10.9. Note that Emacs 23 and later\nalready contain the official GUI support via the NS (Cocoa) port for\nMac OS X 10.4 and later. So if it is good enough for you, then you\ndon't need to try this.\n","versionString":"24.4-mac-5.3","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0+"},"versionNumberList":[24,4,"-mac-5.3"]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["emacs24Macport_24_4"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/editors/emacs-24/macport-24.4.nix:72","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["x86_64-darwin"]}}
