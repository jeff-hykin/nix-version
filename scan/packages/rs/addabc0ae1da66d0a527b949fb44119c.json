{"frozen":{"name":"rs","shortDescription":"Reshape a data array from standard input","longDescription":"rs reads the standard input, interpreting each line as a row of blank-\nseparated entries in an array, transforms the array according to the op-\ntions, and writes it on the standard output. With no arguments (argc < 2)\nit transforms stream input into a columnar format convenient for terminal\nviewing, i.e. if the length (in bytes!) of the first line is smaller than\nthe display width, -et is implied, -t otherwise.\n\nThe shape of the input array is deduced from the number of lines and the\nnumber of columns on the first line. If that shape is inconvenient, a more\nuseful one might be obtained by skipping some of the input with the -k\noption. Other options control interpretation of the input columns.\n\nThe shape of the output array is influenced by the rows and cols specifi-\ncations, which should be positive integers. If only one of them is a po-\nsitive integer, rs computes a value for the other which will accommodate\nall of the data. When necessary, missing data are supplied in a manner\nspecified by the options and surplus data are deleted. There are options\nto control presentation of the output columns, including transposition of\nthe rows and columns.\n","versionString":"20200313","homepage":"https://www.mirbsd.org/htman/i386/man1/rs.htm","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["rs"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/text/rs/default.nix:24","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["rs"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/text/rs/default.nix:24","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-solaris","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox"]}}
