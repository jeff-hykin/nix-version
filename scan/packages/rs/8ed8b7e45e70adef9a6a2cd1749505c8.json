{"frozen":{"name":"rs","shortDescription":"Reshape a data array from standard input","longDescription":"rs reads the standard input, interpreting each line as a row of blank-\nseparated entries in an array, transforms the array according to the op-\ntions, and writes it on the standard output. With no arguments (argc < 2)\nit transforms stream input into a columnar format convenient for terminal\nviewing, i.e. if the length (in bytes!) of the first line is smaller than\nthe display width, -et is implied, -t otherwise.\n\nThe shape of the input array is deduced from the number of lines and the\nnumber of columns on the first line. If that shape is inconvenient, a more\nuseful one might be obtained by skipping some of the input with the -k\noption. Other options control interpretation of the input columns.\n\nThe shape of the output array is influenced by the rows and cols specifi-\ncations, which should be positive integers. If only one of them is a po-\nsitive integer, rs computes a value for the other which will accommodate\nall of the data. When necessary, missing data are supplied in a manner\nspecified by the options and surplus data are deleted. There are options\nto control presentation of the output columns, including transposition of\nthe rows and columns.\n","versionString":"20200313","homepage":"https://www.mirbsd.org/htman/i386/man1/rs.htm","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["rs"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/text/rs/default.nix:24","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["rs"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/text/rs/default.nix:24","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
