{"frozen":{"name":"gdbm","shortDescription":"GNU dbm key/value database library","longDescription":"GNU dbm (or GDBM, for short) is a library of database functions that\n        use extensible hashing and work similar to the standard UNIX dbm.\n        These routines are provided to a programmer needing to create and\n        manipulate a hashed database.\n\n        The basic use of GDBM is to store key/data pairs in a data file.\n        Each key must be unique and each key is paired with only one data\n        item.\n\n        The library provides primitives for storing key/data pairs,\n        searching and retrieving the data by its key and deleting a key\n        along with its data.  It also support sequential iteration over all\n        key/data pairs in a database.\n\n        For compatibility with programs using old UNIX dbm function, the\n        package also provides traditional dbm and ndbm interfaces.\n","versionString":"1.11","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/gdbm/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0+"},"versionNumberList":[1,11]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["gdbm"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/gdbm/default.nix:14","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
