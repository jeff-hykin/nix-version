{"frozen":{"name":"gdbm","shortDescription":"GNU dbm key/value database library","longDescription":"GNU dbm (or GDBM, for short) is a library of database functions that\n        use extensible hashing and work similar to the standard UNIX dbm.\n        These routines are provided to a programmer needing to create and\n        manipulate a hashed database.\n\n        The basic use of GDBM is to store key/data pairs in a data file.\n        Each key must be unique and each key is paired with only one data\n        item.\n\n        The library provides primitives for storing key/data pairs,\n        searching and retrieving the data by its key and deleting a key\n        along with its data.  It also support sequential iteration over all\n        key/data pairs in a database.\n\n        For compatibility with programs using old UNIX dbm function, the\n        package also provides traditional dbm and ndbm interfaces.\n","versionString":"1.18.1","homepage":"https://www.gnu.org/software/gdbm/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,18,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["gdbm"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/gdbm/default.nix:42","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
