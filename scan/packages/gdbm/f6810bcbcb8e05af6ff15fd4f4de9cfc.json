{"frozen":{"name":"gdbm","shortDescription":"GNU dbm key/value database library","longDescription":"GNU dbm (or GDBM, for short) is a library of database functions that\nuse extensible hashing and work similar to the standard UNIX dbm.\nThese routines are provided to a programmer needing to create and\nmanipulate a hashed database.\n\nThe basic use of GDBM is to store key/data pairs in a data file.\nEach key must be unique and each key is paired with only one data\nitem.\n\nThe library provides primitives for storing key/data pairs,\nsearching and retrieving the data by its key and deleting a key\nalong with its data.  It also support sequential iteration over all\nkey/data pairs in a database.\n\nFor compatibility with programs using old UNIX dbm function, the\npackage also provides traditional dbm and ndbm interfaces.\n","versionString":"1.19","homepage":"https://www.gnu.org/software/gdbm/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,19]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["gdbm"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/gdbm/default.nix:43","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-windows","i686-windows","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","arm-none","armv6l-none","aarch64-none","avr-none","i686-none","x86_64-none","powerpc-none","msp430-none","riscv64-none","riscv32-none","vc4-none","or1k-none","mmix-mmixware","js-ghcjs","aarch64-genode","i686-genode","x86_64-genode"]}}
