It is similar\nto ctags or etags but is different from them at the point of\nindependence of any editor.  It runs on a UNIX (POSIX) compatible\noperating system like GNU and BSD.\n","versionString":"6.2.2","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/global/","license":"GPLv3+","versionNumberList":[6,2,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["global"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
