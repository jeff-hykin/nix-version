So if you generated a large amount of data years\nago, forgot to clean it up, and have never used it since, then it ought\nin principle to be possible to use those last-access time stamps to tell\nthe difference between that and a large amount of data you're still\nusing regularly.\n\nagedu uses this information to tell you which files waste disk space when\nyou haven't used them since a long time.\n","versionString":"20180918.80c7beb","homepage":"https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/agedu/","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[20180918,80,"c7beb"]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["agedu"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/agedu/default.nix:18","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
