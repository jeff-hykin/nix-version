So if you generated a large amount of data years\nago, forgot to clean it up, and have never used it since, then it ought\nin principle to be possible to use those last-access time stamps to tell\nthe difference between that and a large amount of data you're still\nusing regularly.\n\nagedu uses this information to tell you which files waste disk space when\nyou haven't used them since a long time.\n","versionString":"20180918.80c7beb","homepage":"https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/agedu/","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[20180918,80,"c7beb"]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["agedu"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/agedu/default.nix:18","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
