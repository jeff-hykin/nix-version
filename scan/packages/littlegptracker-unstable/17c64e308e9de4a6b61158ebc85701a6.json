{"frozen":{"name":"littlegptracker-unstable","shortDescription":"A music tracker similar to lsdj optimised to run on portable game consoles","longDescription":"LittleGPTracker (a.k.a 'The piggy', 'lgpt') is a music tracker optimised\nto run on portable game consoles. It is currently running on Game Park's\nGP2x & Caanoo, PSP, Dingoo, Windows, Mac OSX (intel/ppc) & Linux (Debian).\n\nIt implements the user interface of littlesounddj, a very famous tracker\nfor the Gameboy platform that has been tried and tested by many users over\nthe years, leading to a little complex but yet extremely efficent way of\nworking.\n\nPiggy currently supports 8 monophonic 16Bit/44.1Khz stereo sample playback\nchannels. Additionally, the program can drive MIDI instruments (with the\ngp32 and gp2x a custom MIDI interface is required).\n","versionString":"2020-11-26","homepage":"http://www.littlegptracker.com/","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["littlegptracker"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/littlegptracker/default.nix:49","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-windows","i686-windows","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","arm-none","armv6l-none","aarch64-none","avr-none","i686-none","x86_64-none","powerpc-none","msp430-none","riscv64-none","riscv32-none","vc4-none","or1k-none","mmix-mmixware","js-ghcjs","aarch64-genode","i686-genode","x86_64-genode"]}}
