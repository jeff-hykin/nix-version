{"frozen":{"name":"galaxis","shortDescription":"Rescue lifeboats lost in interstellar space","longDescription":"Lifeboats from a crippled interstellar liner are adrift in a starfield. To\nfind them, you can place probes that look in all eight compass directions\nand tell you how many lifeboats they see. If you drop a probe directly on\na lifeboat it will be revealed immediately. Your objective: find the\nlifeboats as quickly as possible, before the stranded passengers run out\nof oxygen!\n\nThis is a UNIX-hosted, curses-based clone of the nifty little Macintosh\nfreeware game Galaxis. It doesn't have the super-simple, point-and-click\ninterface of the original, but compensates by automating away some of the\ngame's simpler deductions.\n","versionString":"1.10","homepage":"http://catb.org/~esr/galaxis/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,10]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["galaxis"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/games/galaxis/default.nix:28","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
