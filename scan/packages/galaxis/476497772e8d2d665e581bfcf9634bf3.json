{"frozen":{"name":"galaxis","shortDescription":"Rescue lifeboats lost in interstellar space","longDescription":"Lifeboats from a crippled interstellar liner are adrift in a starfield. To\nfind them, you can place probes that look in all eight compass directions\nand tell you how many lifeboats they see. If you drop a probe directly on\na lifeboat it will be revealed immediately. Your objective: find the\nlifeboats as quickly as possible, before the stranded passengers run out\nof oxygen!\n\nThis is a UNIX-hosted, curses-based clone of the nifty little Macintosh\nfreeware game Galaxis. It doesn't have the super-simple, point-and-click\ninterface of the original, but compensates by automating away some of the\ngame's simpler deductions.\n","versionString":"1.10","homepage":"http://catb.org/~esr/galaxis/","license":{"deprecated":true,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,10]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["galaxis"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/games/galaxis/default.nix:28","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["galaxis"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/games/galaxis/default.nix:28","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
