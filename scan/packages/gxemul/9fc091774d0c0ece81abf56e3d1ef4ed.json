Several real machines have been implemented within the\nframework, consisting of processors (ARM, MIPS, Motorola 88K,\nPowerPC, and SuperH) and surrounding hardware components such as\nframebuffers, interrupt controllers, busses, disk controllers,\nand serial controllers. The emulation is working well enough to\nallow several unmodified \"guest\" operating systems to run.\n","versionString":"0.6.2","homepage":"http://gavare.se/gxemul/","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,6,2]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["gxemul"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/misc/emulators/gxemul/default.nix:23","date":"2021-02-24"}]}}
