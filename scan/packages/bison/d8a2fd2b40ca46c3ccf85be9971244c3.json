{"frozen":{"name":"bison","shortDescription":"Yacc-compatible parser generator","longDescription":"Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an\nannotated context-free grammar into an LALR(1) or GLR parser for\nthat grammar.  Once you are proficient with Bison, you can use\nit to develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used\nin simple desk calculators to complex programming languages.\n\nBison is upward compatible with Yacc: all properly-written Yacc\ngrammars ought to work with Bison with no change.  Anyone\nfamiliar with Yacc should be able to use Bison with little\ntrouble.  You need to be fluent in C or C++ programming in order\nto use Bison.\n","versionString":"3.5.4","homepage":"https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,5,4]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["bison_3_5"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/parsing/bison/default.nix:25","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["bison"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/parsing/bison/default.nix:20","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
