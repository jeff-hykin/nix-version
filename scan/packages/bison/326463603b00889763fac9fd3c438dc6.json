{"frozen":{"name":"bison","shortDescription":"Yacc-compatible parser generator","longDescription":"Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an\nannotated context-free grammar into an LALR(1) or GLR parser for\nthat grammar.  Once you are proficient with Bison, you can use\nit to develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used\nin simple desk calculators to complex programming languages.\n\nBison is upward compatible with Yacc: all properly-written Yacc\ngrammars ought to work with Bison with no change.  Anyone\nfamiliar with Yacc should be able to use Bison with little\ntrouble.  You need to be fluent in C or C++ programming in order\nto use Bison.\n","versionString":"2.7","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0+"},"versionNumberList":[2,7]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["bison2"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/parsing/bison/2.x.nix:19","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
