{"frozen":{"name":"bison","shortDescription":"GNU Bison, a Yacc-compatible parser generator","longDescription":"Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an\nannotated context-free grammar into an LALR(1) or GLR parser for\nthat grammar.  Once you are proficient with Bison, you can use\nit to develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used\nin simple desk calculators to complex programming languages.\n\nBison is upward compatible with Yacc: all properly-written Yacc\ngrammars ought to work with Bison with no change.  Anyone\nfamiliar with Yacc should be able to use Bison with little\ntrouble.  You need to be fluent in C or C++ programming in order\nto use Bison.\n","versionString":"2.6.5","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/","license":"GPLv3+","versionNumberList":[2,6,5]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["bison"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","powerpc-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
