A\nfirst service implemented on top of the networking layer\nallows anonymous censorship-resistant file-sharing.  Anonymity\nis provided by making messages originating from a peer\nindistinguishable from messages that the peer is routing.  All\npeers act as routers and use link-encrypted connections with\nstable bandwidth utilization to communicate with each other.\nGNUnet uses a simple, excess-based economic model to allocate\nresources.  Peers in GNUnet monitor each others behavior with\nrespect to resource usage; peers that contribute to the\nnetwork are rewarded with better service.\n","versionString":"gnunet-git-ce2864cfaa27e55096b480bf35db5f8cee2a5e7e","homepage":"https://gnunet.org/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"agpl3Plus","spdxId":"AGPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["gnunet_git"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/networking/p2p/gnunet/git.nix:68","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
