{"frozen":{"name":"gperf","shortDescription":"Perfect hash function generator","longDescription":"GNU gperf is a perfect hash function generator.  For a given\nlist of strings, it produces a hash function and hash table, in\nform of C or C++ code, for looking up a value depending on the\ninput string.  The hash function is perfect, which means that\nthe hash table has no collisions, and the hash table lookup\nneeds a single string comparison only.\n\nGNU gperf is highly customizable.  There are options for\ngenerating C or C++ code, for emitting switch statements or\nnested ifs instead of a hash table, and for tuning the algorithm\nemployed by gperf.\n","versionString":"3.0.4","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0+"},"versionNumberList":[3,0,4]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["gperf"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/misc/gperf/default.nix:12","date":"2015-08-08"}]}}
