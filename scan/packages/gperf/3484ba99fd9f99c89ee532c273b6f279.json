{"frozen":{"name":"gperf","shortDescription":"GNU gperf, a perfect hash function generator","longDescription":"GNU gperf is a perfect hash function generator.  For a given\nlist of strings, it produces a hash function and hash table, in\nform of C or C++ code, for looking up a value depending on the\ninput string.  The hash function is perfect, which means that\nthe hash table has no collisions, and the hash table lookup\nneeds a single string comparison only.\n\nGNU gperf is highly customizable.  There are options for\ngenerating C or C++ code, for emitting switch statements or\nnested ifs instead of a hash table, and for tuning the algorithm\nemployed by gperf.\n","versionString":"3.0.4","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/","license":"GPLv3+","versionNumberList":[3,0,4]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["gperf"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}]}}
