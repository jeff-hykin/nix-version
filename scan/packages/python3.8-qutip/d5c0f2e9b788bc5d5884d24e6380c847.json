{"frozen":{"name":"python3.8-qutip","shortDescription":"QuTiP - Quantum Toolbox in Python","longDescription":"QuTiP is open-source software for simulating the dynamics of\nopen quantum systems. The QuTiP library depends on the\nexcellent Numpy and Scipy numerical packages. In addition,\ngraphical output is provided by Matplotlib. QuTiP aims to\nprovide user-friendly and efficient numerical simulations of a\nwide variety of Hamiltonians, including those with arbitrary\ntime-dependence, commonly found in a wide range of physics\napplications such as quantum optics, trapped ions,\nsuperconducting circuits, and quantum nanomechanical\nresonators.\n","versionString":"2.2.0","homepage":"http://qutip.org/","license":{"fullName":"BSD Zero Clause License","shortName":"bsd0","spdxId":"0BSD","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/0BSD.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,2,0]},"flexible":{"broken":true,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["python38Packages","qutip"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/python-modules/qutip/default.nix:27","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin"]}}
