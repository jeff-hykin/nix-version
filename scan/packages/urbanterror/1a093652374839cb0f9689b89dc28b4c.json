Urban Terror can be described as a Hollywood\ntactical shooter; somewhat realism based, but the motto is \"fun over\nrealism\". This results in a very unique, enjoyable and addictive game.\n","versionString":"4.2.009","homepage":"http://www.urbanterror.net","license":["unfree-redistributable"],"versionNumberList":[4,2,9]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["urbanterror"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}]}}
