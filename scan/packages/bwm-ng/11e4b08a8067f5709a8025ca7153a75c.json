{"frozen":{"name":"bwm-ng","shortDescription":"A small and simple console-based live network and disk io bandwidth monitor","longDescription":"Features\n\n    supports /proc/net/dev, netstat, getifaddr, sysctl, kstat, /proc/diskstats /proc/partitions, IOKit, devstat and libstatgrab\n    unlimited number of interfaces/devices supported\n    interfaces/devices are added or removed dynamically from list\n    white-/blacklist of interfaces/devices\n    output of KB/s, Kb/s, packets, errors, average, max and total sum\n    output in curses, plain console, CSV or HTML\n    configfile\n\nShort list of changes since 0.5 (for full list read changelog):\n\n    curses2 output, a nice bar chart\n    disk input for bsd/macosx/linux/solaris\n    win32 network bandwidth support\n    moved to autotools\n    alot fixes\n\nInfo\nThis was influenced by the old bwm util written by Barney (barney@freewill.tzo.com) which had some issues with faster interfaces and was very simple. Since i had almost all code done anyway for other projects, i decided to create my own version.\n\nI actually don't know if netstat input is useful at all. I saw this elsewhere, so i added it. Its target is \"netstat 1.42 (2001-04-15)\" linux or Free/Open/netBSD. If there are other formats i would be happy to add them.\n\n(from homepage)\n","versionString":"0.6","homepage":"http://www.gropp.org/?id=projects&sub=bwm-ng","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0"},"versionNumberList":[0,6]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["bwm_ng"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/networking/bwm-ng/default.nix:17","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
