Since i had almost all code done anyway for other projects, i decided to create my own version.\n\nI actually dont know if netstat input is usefull at all. I saw this elsewhere, so i added it. Its target is \"netstat 1.42 (2001-04-15)\" linux or Free/Open/netBSD. If there are other formats i would be happy to add them.\n\n(from homepage)\n","versionString":"0.6","homepage":"http://www.gropp.org/?id=projects&sub=bwm-ng","license":"GPLv2","versionNumberList":[0,6]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["bwm_ng"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","powerpc-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
