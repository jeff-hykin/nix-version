{"frozen":{"name":"autogen","shortDescription":"Automated text and program generation tool","longDescription":"AutoGen is a tool designed to simplify the creation and maintenance\nof programs that contain large amounts of repetitious text.  It is\nespecially valuable in programs that have several blocks of text that\nmust be kept synchronized.\n\nAutoGen can now accept XML files as definition input, in addition to\nCGI data (for producing dynamic HTML) and traditional AutoGen\ndefinitions.\n\nA common example where this would be useful is in creating and\nmaintaining the code required for processing program options.\nProcessing options requires multiple constructs to be maintained in\nparallel in different places in your program.  Options maintenance\nneeds to be done countless times.  So, AutoGen comes with an add-on\npackage named AutoOpts that simplifies the maintenance and\ndocumentation of program options.\n","versionString":"5.18","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/autogen/","license":[{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0+"},{"fullName":"GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"lgpl3Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-3.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0+"}],"versionNumberList":[5,18]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["autogen"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/misc/autogen/default.nix:28","date":"2015-08-08"}]}}
