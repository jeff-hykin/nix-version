{"frozen":{"name":"libchop","shortDescription":"libchop, tools & library for data backup and distributed storage","longDescription":"Libchop is a set of utilities and library for data backup and\n        distributed storage.  Its main application is chop-backup, an\n        encrypted backup program that supports data integrity checks,\n        versioning at little cost, distribution among several sites,\n        selective sharing of stored data, adaptive compression, and more.\n        The library itself, which chop-backup builds upon, implements\n        storage techniques such as content-based addressing, content hash\n        keys, Merkle trees, similarity detection, and lossless compression.\n        It makes it easy to combine them in different ways.  The\n        ‘chop-archiver’ and ‘chop-block-server’ tools, illustrated in the\n        manual, provide direct access to these facilities from the command\n        line.  It is written in C and has Guile (Scheme) bindings.\n","versionString":"0.5.2","homepage":"http://nongnu.org/libchop/","license":"GPLv3+","versionNumberList":[0,5,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["libchop"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
