{"frozen":{"name":"libchop","shortDescription":"Tools & library for data backup and distributed storage","longDescription":"Libchop is a set of utilities and library for data backup and\n        distributed storage.  Its main application is chop-backup, an\n        encrypted backup program that supports data integrity checks,\n        versioning at little cost, distribution among several sites,\n        selective sharing of stored data, adaptive compression, and more.\n        The library itself, which chop-backup builds upon, implements\n        storage techniques such as content-based addressing, content hash\n        keys, Merkle trees, similarity detection, and lossless compression.\n        It makes it easy to combine them in different ways.  The\n        ‘chop-archiver’ and ‘chop-block-server’ tools, illustrated in the\n        manual, provide direct access to these facilities from the command\n        line.  It is written in C and has Guile (Scheme) bindings.\n","versionString":"0.5.2","homepage":"https://www.nongnu.org/libchop/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,5,2]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["libchop"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/libchop/default.nix:36","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["libchop"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/libchop/default.nix:37","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
