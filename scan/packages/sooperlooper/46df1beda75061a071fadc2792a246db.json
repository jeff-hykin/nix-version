{"frozen":{"name":"sooperlooper","shortDescription":"A live looping sampler capable of immediate loop recording, overdubbing, multiplying, reversing and more","longDescription":"It allows for multiple simultaneous multi-channel loops limited only by your computer's available memory.\nThe application is a standalone JACK client with an engine controllable via OSC and MIDI.\nIt also includes a GUI which communicates with the engine via OSC (even over a network) for user-friendly control on a desktop.\nHowever, this kind of live performance looping tool is most effectively used via hardware (midi footpedals, etc)\nand the engine can be run standalone on a computer without a monitor.\n","versionString":"1.7.4","homepage":"http://essej.net/sooperlooper/","license":{"deprecated":true,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,7,4]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["sooperlooper"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/sooperlooper/default.nix:57","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["sooperlooper"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/sooperlooper/default.nix:57","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
