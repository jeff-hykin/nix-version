{"frozen":{"name":"sooperlooper","shortDescription":"A live looping sampler capable of immediate loop recording, overdubbing, multiplying, reversing and more","longDescription":"It allows for multiple simultaneous multi-channel loops limited only by your computer's available memory.\nThe application is a standalone JACK client with an engine controllable via OSC and MIDI.\nIt also includes a GUI which communicates with the engine via OSC (even over a network) for user-friendly control on a desktop.\nHowever, this kind of live performance looping tool is most effectively used via hardware (midi footpedals, etc)\nand the engine can be run standalone on a computer without a monitor.\n","versionString":"1.7.3","homepage":"http://essej.net/sooperlooper/index.html","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0"},"versionNumberList":[1,7,3]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["sooperlooper"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/sooperlooper/default.nix:19","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
