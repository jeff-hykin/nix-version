{"frozen":{"name":"honggfuzz","shortDescription":"A security oriented, feedback-driven, evolutionary, easy-to-use fuzzer","longDescription":"Honggfuzz is a security oriented, feedback-driven, evolutionary,\neasy-to-use fuzzer with interesting analysis options. It is\nmulti-process and multi-threaded, blazingly fast when the persistent\nfuzzing mode is used and has a solid track record of uncovered security\nbugs.\n\nHonggfuzz uses low-level interfaces to monitor processes and it will\ndiscover and report hijacked/ignored signals from crashes. Feed it\na simple corpus directory (can even be empty for the feedback-driven\nfuzzing), and it will work its way up, expanding it by utilizing\nfeedback-based coverage metrics.\n","versionString":"2.4","homepage":"https://honggfuzz.dev/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"Apache License 2.0","redistributable":true,"shortName":"asl20","spdxId":"Apache-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,4]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["honggfuzz"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/security/honggfuzz/default.nix:31","date":"2021-10-20"}],"platforms":["x86_64-linux"]}}
