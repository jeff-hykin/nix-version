{"frozen":{"name":"honggfuzz","shortDescription":"A security oriented, feedback-driven, evolutionary, easy-to-use fuzzer","longDescription":"Honggfuzz is a security oriented, feedback-driven, evolutionary,\neasy-to-use fuzzer with interesting analysis options. It is\nmulti-process and multi-threaded, blazingly fast when the persistent\nfuzzing mode is used and has a solid track record of uncovered security\nbugs.\n\nHonggfuzz uses low-level interfaces to monitor processes and it will\ndiscover and report hijacked/ignored signals from crashes. Feed it\na simple corpus directory (can even be empty for the feedback-driven\nfuzzing), and it will work its way up, expanding it by utilizing\nfeedback-based coverage metrics.\n","versionString":"2.3.1","homepage":"https://honggfuzz.dev/","license":{"fullName":"Apache License 2.0","shortName":"asl20","spdxId":"Apache-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,3,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["honggfuzz"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/security/honggfuzz/default.nix:31","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["x86_64-linux"]}}
