{"frozen":{"name":"input-fonts","shortDescription":"Fonts for Code, from Font Bureau","longDescription":"Input is a font family designed for computer programming, data,\nand text composition. It was designed by David Jonathan Ross\nbetween 2012 and 2014 and published by The Font Bureau. It\ncontains a wide array of styles so you can fine-tune the\ntypography that works best in your editing environment.\n\nInput Mono is a monospaced typeface, where all characters occupy\na fixed width. Input Sans and Serif are proportional typefaces\nthat are designed with all of the features of a good monospace —\ngenerous spacing, large punctuation, and easily distinguishable\ncharacters — but without the limitations of a fixed width.\n","versionString":"2019-11-25","homepage":"https://input.fontbureau.com","license":{"free":false,"fullName":"Unfree","shortName":"unfree"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":true,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["input-fonts"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/data/fonts/input-fonts/default.nix:31","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["input-fonts"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/data/fonts/input-fonts/default.nix:31","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-windows","i686-windows","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","arm-none","armv6l-none","aarch64-none","avr-none","i686-none","x86_64-none","powerpc-none","msp430-none","riscv64-none","riscv32-none","vc4-none","or1k-none","mmix-mmixware","js-ghcjs","aarch64-genode","i686-genode","x86_64-genode"]}}
