{"frozen":{"name":"gnunet","shortDescription":"GNU's decentralized anonymous and censorship-resistant P2P framework","longDescription":"GNUnet is a framework for secure peer-to-peer networking that\ndoes not use any centralized or otherwise trusted services.  A\nfirst service implemented on top of the networking layer\nallows anonymous censorship-resistant file-sharing.  Anonymity\nis provided by making messages originating from a peer\nindistinguishable from messages that the peer is routing.  All\npeers act as routers and use link-encrypted connections with\nstable bandwidth utilization to communicate with each other.\nGNUnet uses a simple, excess-based economic model to allocate\nresources.  Peers in GNUnet monitor each others behavior with\nrespect to resource usage; peers that contribute to the\nnetwork are rewarded with better service.\n","versionString":"0.14.0","homepage":"https://gnunet.org/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"agpl3Plus","spdxId":"AGPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,14,0]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["gnunet"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/networking/p2p/gnunet/default.nix:50","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","powerpc64-linux","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
