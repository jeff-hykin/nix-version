{"frozen":{"name":"libsndfile","shortDescription":"A C library for reading and writing files containing sampled sound","longDescription":"Libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing\nsampled sound (such as MS Windows WAV and the Apple/SGI AIFF format)\nthrough one standard library interface.  It is released in source\ncode format under the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe library was written to compile and run on a Linux system but\nshould compile and run on just about any Unix (including MacOS X).\nThere are also pre-compiled binaries available for 32 and 64 bit\nwindows.\n\nIt was designed to handle both little-endian (such as WAV) and\nbig-endian (such as AIFF) data, and to compile and run correctly on\nlittle-endian (such as Intel and DEC/Compaq Alpha) processor systems\nas well as big-endian processor systems such as Motorola 68k, Power\nPC, MIPS and SPARC.  Hopefully the design of the library will also\nmake it easy to extend for reading and writing new sound file\nformats.\n","versionString":"1.0.23","homepage":"http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License version 2 or later","shortName":"LGPLv2+","url":"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,0,23]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["libsndfile"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}]}}
