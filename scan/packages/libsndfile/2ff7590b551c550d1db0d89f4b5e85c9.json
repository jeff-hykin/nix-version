{"frozen":{"name":"libsndfile","shortDescription":"A C library for reading and writing files containing sampled sound","longDescription":"Libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing\nsampled sound (such as MS Windows WAV and the Apple/SGI AIFF format)\nthrough one standard library interface.  It is released in source\ncode format under the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe library was written to compile and run on a Linux system but\nshould compile and run on just about any Unix (including macOS).\nThere are also pre-compiled binaries available for 32 and 64 bit\nwindows.\n\nIt was designed to handle both little-endian (such as WAV) and\nbig-endian (such as AIFF) data, and to compile and run correctly on\nlittle-endian (such as Intel and DEC/Compaq Alpha) processor systems\nas well as big-endian processor systems such as Motorola 68k, Power\nPC, MIPS and SPARC.  Hopefully the design of the library will also\nmake it easy to extend for reading and writing new sound file\nformats.\n","versionString":"1.0.28","homepage":"http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,0,28]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["libsndfile"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/libsndfile/default.nix:65","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"families":{"bsd":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"bsd"}}}},{"kernel":{"families":{"darwin":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"darwin"}}}},{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}},{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"solaris"}},{"abi":{"_type":"abi","name":"cygnus"},"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"pe"},"families":{},"name":"windows"}}]}}
