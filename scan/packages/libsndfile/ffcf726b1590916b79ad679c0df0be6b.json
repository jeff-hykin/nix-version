{"frozen":{"name":"libsndfile","shortDescription":"A C library for reading and writing files containing sampled sound","longDescription":"Libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing\nsampled sound (such as MS Windows WAV and the Apple/SGI AIFF format)\nthrough one standard library interface.  It is released in source\ncode format under the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe library was written to compile and run on a Linux system but\nshould compile and run on just about any Unix (including macOS).\nThere are also pre-compiled binaries available for 32 and 64 bit\nwindows.\n\nIt was designed to handle both little-endian (such as WAV) and\nbig-endian (such as AIFF) data, and to compile and run correctly on\nlittle-endian (such as Intel and DEC/Compaq Alpha) processor systems\nas well as big-endian processor systems such as Motorola 68k, Power\nPC, MIPS and SPARC.  Hopefully the design of the library will also\nmake it easy to extend for reading and writing new sound file\nformats.\n","versionString":"1.0.28","homepage":"http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,0,28]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["libsndfile"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/libsndfile/default.nix:65","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
