{"frozen":{"name":"libsndfile","shortDescription":"A C library for reading and writing files containing sampled sound","longDescription":"Libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing\nsampled sound (such as MS Windows WAV and the Apple/SGI AIFF format)\nthrough one standard library interface.  It is released in source\ncode format under the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe library was written to compile and run on a Linux system but\nshould compile and run on just about any Unix (including MacOS X).\nThere are also pre-compiled binaries available for 32 and 64 bit\nwindows.\n\nIt was designed to handle both little-endian (such as WAV) and\nbig-endian (such as AIFF) data, and to compile and run correctly on\nlittle-endian (such as Intel and DEC/Compaq Alpha) processor systems\nas well as big-endian processor systems such as Motorola 68k, Power\nPC, MIPS and SPARC.  Hopefully the design of the library will also\nmake it easy to extend for reading and writing new sound file\nformats.\n","versionString":"1.0.25","homepage":"http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0+"},"versionNumberList":[1,0,25]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["libsndfile"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/libsndfile/default.nix:24","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
