{"frozen":{"name":"libsndfile","shortDescription":"A C library for reading and writing files containing sampled sound","longDescription":"Libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing\nsampled sound (such as MS Windows WAV and the Apple/SGI AIFF format)\nthrough one standard library interface.  It is released in source\ncode format under the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe library was written to compile and run on a Linux system but\nshould compile and run on just about any Unix (including macOS).\nThere are also pre-compiled binaries available for 32 and 64 bit\nwindows.\n\nIt was designed to handle both little-endian (such as WAV) and\nbig-endian (such as AIFF) data, and to compile and run correctly on\nlittle-endian (such as Intel and DEC/Compaq Alpha) processor systems\nas well as big-endian processor systems such as Motorola 68k, Power\nPC, MIPS and SPARC.  Hopefully the design of the library will also\nmake it easy to extend for reading and writing new sound file\nformats.\n","versionString":"1.0.31","homepage":"https://libsndfile.github.io/libsndfile/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,0,31]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["libsndfile"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/libsndfile/default.nix:35","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["libsndfile"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/libsndfile/default.nix:35","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-solaris","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox"]}}
