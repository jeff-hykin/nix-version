{"frozen":{"name":"commoncpp2","shortDescription":"GNU Common C++, a portable, highly optimized C++ class framework","longDescription":"GNU Common C++ and GNU uCommon are very portable and highly\n        optimized class framework for writing C++ applications that need to\n        use threads and support concurrent sychronization, and that use\n        sockets, XML parsing, object serialization, thread-optimized String\n        and data structure classes, etc.  This framework offers a class\n        foundation that hides platform differences from your C++ application\n        so that you need not write platform specific code.  GNU Common C++\n        has been ported to compile nativily on most platforms which support\n        either posix threads, or on maybe be used with Debian hosted mingw32\n        to build native threading applications for Microsoft Windows.\n","versionString":"1.8.1","homepage":"https://www.gnu.org/software/commoncpp/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,8,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["commoncpp2"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/commoncpp2/default.nix:18","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
