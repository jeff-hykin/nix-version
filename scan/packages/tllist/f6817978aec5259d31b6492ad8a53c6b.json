{"frozen":{"name":"tllist","shortDescription":"C header file only implementation of a typed linked list","longDescription":"Most C implementations of linked list are untyped. That is, their data\ncarriers are typically void *. This is error prone since your compiler\nwill not be able to help you correct your mistakes (oh, was it a\npointer-to-a-pointer... I thought it was just a pointer...).\n\ntllist addresses this by using pre-processor macros to implement dynamic\ntypes, where the data carrier is typed to whatever you want; both\nprimitive data types are supported as well as aggregated ones such as\nstructs, enums and unions.\n","versionString":"1.0.5","homepage":"https://codeberg.org/dnkl/tllist","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,0,5]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["tllist"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/tllist/default.nix:24","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
