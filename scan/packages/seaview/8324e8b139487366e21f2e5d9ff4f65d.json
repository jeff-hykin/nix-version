{"frozen":{"name":"seaview","shortDescription":"GUI for molecular phylogeny","longDescription":"SeaView is a multiplatform, graphical user interface for multiple sequence alignment and molecular phylogeny.\n  - SeaView reads and writes various file formats (NEXUS, MSF, CLUSTAL, FASTA, PHYLIP, MASE, Newick) of DNA and protein sequences and of phylogenetic trees.\n  - SeaView drives programs muscle or Clustal Omega for multiple sequence alignment, and also allows to use any external alignment algorithm able to read and write FASTA-formatted files.\n  - Seaview drives the Gblocks program to select blocks of evolutionarily conserved sites.\n  - SeaView computes phylogenetic trees by\n    + parsimony, using PHYLIP's dnapars/protpars algorithm,\n    + distance, with NJ or BioNJ algorithms on a variety of evolutionary distances,\n    + maximum likelihood, driving program PhyML 3.1.\n  - Seaview can use the Transfer Bootstrap Expectation method to compute the bootstrap support of PhyML and distance trees.\n  - SeaView prints and draws phylogenetic trees on screen, SVG, PDF or PostScript files.\n  - SeaView allows to download sequences from EMBL/GenBank/UniProt using the Internet.\n\nSeaview is published in:\n\n    Gouy M., Guindon S. & Gascuel O.
