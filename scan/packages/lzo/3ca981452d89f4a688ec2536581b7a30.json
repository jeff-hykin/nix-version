{"frozen":{"name":"lzo","shortDescription":"Real-time data (de)compression library","longDescription":"LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.\nBoth the source code and the compressed data format are designed to be\nportable across platforms.\nLZO offers pretty fast compression and *extremely* fast decompression.\nWhile it favours speed over compression ratio, it includes slower\ncompression levels achieving a quite competitive compression ratio\nwhile still decompressing at this very high speed.\n","versionString":"2.10","homepage":"http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,10]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["lzo"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/lzo/default.nix:18","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
