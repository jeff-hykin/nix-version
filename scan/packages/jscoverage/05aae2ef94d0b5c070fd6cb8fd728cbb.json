{"frozen":{"name":"jscoverage","shortDescription":"Code coverage for JavaScript","longDescription":"JSCoverage is a tool that measures code coverage for JavaScript\nprograms.\n\nCode coverage statistics show which lines of a program have been\nexecuted (and which have been missed). This information is useful\nfor constructing comprehensive test suites (hence, it is often\ncalled test coverage).\n\nJSCoverage works by instrumenting the JavaScript code used in web\npages. Code coverage statistics are collected while the\ninstrumented JavaScript code is executed in a web browser.\n\nJSCoverage supports the complete language syntax described in the\nECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262, 3rd\nedition). JSCoverage works with any modern standards-compliant web\nbrowser - including Internet Explorer (IE 6, 7, and 8), Firefox,\nOpera, Safari, and Google Chrome - on Microsoft Windows and\nGNU/Linux.\n","versionString":"0.5.1","homepage":"http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/","license":"GPLv2","versionNumberList":[0,5,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["jscoverage"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}]}}
