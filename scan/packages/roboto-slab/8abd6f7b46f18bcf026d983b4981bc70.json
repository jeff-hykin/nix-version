{"frozen":{"name":"roboto-slab","shortDescription":"Google Roboto Slab fonts","longDescription":"Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms\nare largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly\nand open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to\nforce a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn't compromise, allowing letters to\nbe settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural\nreading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.\n\nThis is the Roboto Slab family, which can be used alongside the normal\nRoboto family and the Roboto Condensed family.\n","versionString":"2016-01-11","homepage":"https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Slab","license":{"fullName":"Apache License 2.0","shortName":"asl20","spdxId":"Apache-2.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["roboto-slab"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/data/fonts/roboto-slab/default.nix:48","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
