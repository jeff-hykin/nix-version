{"frozen":{"name":"python3.8-ply","shortDescription":"PLY (Python Lex-Yacc), an implementation of the lex and yacc parsing tools for Python","longDescription":"PLY is an implementation of lex and yacc parsing tools for Python.\nIn a nutshell, PLY is nothing more than a straightforward lex/yacc\nimplementation.  Here is a list of its essential features: It's\nimplemented entirely in Python; It uses LR-parsing which is\nreasonably efficient and well suited for larger grammars; PLY\nprovides most of the standard lex/yacc features including support for\nempty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support for\nambiguous grammars; PLY is straightforward to use and provides very\nextensive error checking; PLY doesn't try to do anything more or less\nthan provide the basic lex/yacc functionality.  In other words, it's\nnot a large parsing framework or a component of some larger system.\n","versionString":"3.11","homepage":"http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,11]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["python38Packages","ply"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/python-modules/ply/default.nix:26","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["python38Packages","ply"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/python-modules/ply/default.nix:26","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin"]}}
