{"frozen":{"name":"hadoop","shortDescription":"Framework for distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers","longDescription":"The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for\nthe distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of\ncomputers using a simple programming model. It is designed to\nscale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each\noffering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on\nhardware to deliver high-avaiability, the library itself is\ndesigned to detect and handle failures at the application layer,\nso delivering a highly-availabile service on top of a cluster of\ncomputers, each of which may be prone to failures.\n","versionString":"3.0.3","homepage":"http://hadoop.apache.org/","license":{"fullName":"Apache License 2.0","shortName":"asl20","spdxId":"Apache-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,0,3]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["hadoop_3_0"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/networking/cluster/hadoop/default.nix:99","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["hadoop_3_0"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/networking/cluster/hadoop/default.nix:99","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["x86_64-linux"]}}
