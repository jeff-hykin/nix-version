{"frozen":{"name":"hadoop","shortDescription":"Framework for distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers","longDescription":"The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for\nthe distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of\ncomputers using a simple programming model. It is designed to\nscale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each\noffering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on\nhardware to deliver high-avaiability, the library itself is\ndesigned to detect and handle failures at the application layer,\nso delivering a highly-availabile service on top of a cluster of\ncomputers, each of which may be prone to failures.\n","versionString":"2.8.4","homepage":"https://hadoop.apache.org/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"Apache License 2.0","redistributable":true,"shortName":"asl20","spdxId":"Apache-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,8,4]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["hadoop_2_8"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/networking/cluster/hadoop/default.nix:113","date":"2021-10-20"}],"platforms":["x86_64-linux"]}}
