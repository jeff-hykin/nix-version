{"frozen":{"name":"hadoop","shortDescription":"framework for distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers","longDescription":"The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for\nthe distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of\ncomputers using a simple programming model. It is designed to\nscale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each\noffering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on\nhardware to deliver high-avaiability, the library itself is\ndesigned to detect and handle failures at the application layer,\nso delivering a highly-availabile service on top of a cluster of\ncomputers, each of which may be prone to failures.\n","versionString":"2.0.2-alpha","homepage":"http://hadoop.apache.org/","license":{"fullName":"Apache Software License 2.0","shortName":"ASL2.0","url":"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0"},"versionNumberList":[2,0,2,"-alpha"]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["hadoop"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
