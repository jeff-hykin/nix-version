{"frozen":{"name":"hadoop","shortDescription":"Framework for distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers","longDescription":"The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for\nthe distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of\ncomputers using a simple programming model. It is designed to\nscale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each\noffering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on\nhardware to deliver high-avaiability, the library itself is\ndesigned to detect and handle failures at the application layer,\nso delivering a highly-availabile service on top of a cluster of\ncomputers, each of which may be prone to failures.\n","versionString":"2.8.4","homepage":"http://hadoop.apache.org/","license":{"fullName":"Apache License 2.0","shortName":"asl20","spdxId":"Apache-2.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,8,4]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["hadoop_2_8"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/networking/cluster/hadoop/default.nix:96","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":["x86_64-linux"]}}
