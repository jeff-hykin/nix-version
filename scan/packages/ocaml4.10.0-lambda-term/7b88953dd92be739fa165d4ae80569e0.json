It provides an abstraction for keys,\nmouse events, colors, as well as a set of widgets to write\ncurses-like applications.\n\nThe main objective of lambda-term is to provide a higher level\nfunctional interface to terminal manipulation than, for example,\nncurses, by providing a native OCaml interface instead of bindings to\na C library.\n\nLambda-term integrates with zed to provide text edition facilities in\nconsole applications.\n","versionString":"3.1.0","homepage":"https://github.com/ocaml-community/lambda-term","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,1,0]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["ocamlPackages","lambdaTerm"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/ocaml-modules/lambda-term/default.nix:18","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin"]}}
