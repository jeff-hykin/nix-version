{"frozen":{"name":"FIL-plugins","shortDescription":"a four-band parametric equaliser, which has the nice property of being stable even while parameters are being changed","longDescription":"Each section has an active/bypass switch, frequency, bandwidth and gain controls.\nThere is also a global bypass switch and gain control.\nThe 2nd order resonant filters are implemented using a Mitra-Regalia style lattice filter.\nAll switches and controls are internally smoothed, so they can be used 'live' whithout any clicks or zipper noises.\nThis should make this plugin a good candidate for use in systems that allow automation of plugin control ports, such as Ardour, or for stage use.\n","versionString":"0.3.0","homepage":"http://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/linuxaudio/ladspa/index.html","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,3,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["FIL-plugins"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/FIL-plugins/default.nix:23","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
