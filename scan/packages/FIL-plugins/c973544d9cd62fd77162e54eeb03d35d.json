{"frozen":{"name":"FIL-plugins","shortDescription":"a four-band parametric equaliser, which has the nice property of being stable even while parameters are being changed","longDescription":"Each section has an active/bypass switch, frequency, bandwidth and gain controls.\nThere is also a global bypass switch and gain control.\nThe 2nd order resonant filters are implemented using a Mitra-Regalia style lattice filter.\nAll switches and controls are internally smoothed, so they can be used 'live' whithout any clicks or zipper noises.\nThis should make this plugin a good candidate for use in systems that allow automation of plugin control ports, such as Ardour, or for stage use.\n","versionString":"0.3.0","homepage":"http://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/linuxaudio/ladspa/index.html","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,3,0]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["FIL-plugins"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/FIL-plugins/default.nix:23","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["FIL-plugins"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/FIL-plugins/default.nix:23","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
