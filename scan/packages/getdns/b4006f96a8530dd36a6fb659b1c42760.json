{"frozen":{"name":"getdns","shortDescription":"A modern asynchronous DNS API","longDescription":"getdns is an implementation of a modern asynchronous DNS API; the\nspecification was originally edited by Paul Hoffman. It is intended to make all\ntypes of DNS information easily available to application developers and non-DNS\nexperts. DNSSEC offers a unique global infrastructure for establishing and\nenhancing cryptographic trust relations. With the development of this API the\ndevelopers intend to offer application developers a modern and flexible\ninterface that enables end-to-end trust in the DNS architecture, and which will\ninspire application developers to implement innovative security solutions in\ntheir applications.\n","versionString":"1.5.1","homepage":"https://getdnsapi.net","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,5,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["getdns"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/getdns/default.nix:24","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
