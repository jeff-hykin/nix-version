{"frozen":{"name":"getdns","shortDescription":"A modern asynchronous DNS API","longDescription":"getdns is an implementation of a modern asynchronous DNS API; the\nspecification was originally edited by Paul Hoffman. It is intended to make all\ntypes of DNS information easily available to application developers and non-DNS\nexperts. DNSSEC offers a unique global infrastructure for establishing and\nenhancing cryptographic trust relations. With the development of this API the\ndevelopers intend to offer application developers a modern and flexible\ninterface that enables end-to-end trust in the DNS architecture, and which will\ninspire application developers to implement innovative security solutions in\ntheir applications.\n","versionString":"1.7.0","homepage":"https://getdnsapi.net","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,7,0]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["getdns"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/getdns/default.nix:34","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","aarch64-genode","i686-genode","x86_64-genode","x86_64-solaris","js-ghcjs","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","mmix-mmixware","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","aarch64_be-none","aarch64-none","arm-none","armv6l-none","avr-none","i686-none","msp430-none","or1k-none","m68k-none","powerpc-none","powerpcle-none","riscv32-none","riscv64-none","s390-none","s390x-none","vc4-none","x86_64-none","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","x86_64-windows","i686-windows"]}}
