{"frozen":{"name":"shorewall","shortDescription":"An IP gateway/firewall configuration tool for GNU/Linux","longDescription":"Shorewall is a high-level tool for configuring Netfilter. You describe your\nfirewall/gateway requirements using entries in a set of configuration\nfiles. Shorewall reads those configuration files and with the help of the\niptables, iptables-restore, ip and tc utilities, Shorewall configures\nNetfilter and the Linux networking subsystem to match your requirements.\nShorewall can be used on a dedicated firewall system, a multi-function\ngateway/router/server or on a standalone GNU/Linux system. Shorewall does\nnot use Netfilter's ipchains compatibility mode and can thus take\nadvantage of Netfilter's connection state tracking capabilities.\n","versionString":"5.2.3.3","homepage":"http://www.shorewall.net/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[5,2,3,3]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["shorewall"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/networking/shorewall/default.nix:115","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["shorewall"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/networking/shorewall/default.nix:109","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
