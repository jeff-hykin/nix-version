{"frozen":{"name":"tokyocabinet","shortDescription":"Tokyo Cabinet: a modern implementation of DBM","longDescription":"Tokyo Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The\n        database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of\n        a key and a value.  Every key and value is serial bytes with\n        variable length.  Both binary data and character string can be used\n        as a key and a value.  There is neither concept of data tables nor\n        data types.  Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree, or\n        fixed-length array.\n\n        Tokyo Cabinet is developed as the successor of GDBM and QDBM on the\n        following purposes.  They are achieved and Tokyo Cabinet replaces\n        conventional DBM products: improves space efficiency, improves time\n        efficiency, improves parallelism, improves usability, improves\n        robustness, supports 64-bit architecture.\n","versionString":"1.4.48","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,4,48]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["tokyocabinet"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/tokyo-cabinet/default.nix:20","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["tokyocabinet"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/tokyo-cabinet/default.nix:20","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
