{"frozen":{"name":"tokyocabinet","shortDescription":"Tokyo Cabinet: a modern implementation of DBM","longDescription":"Tokyo Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The\n        database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of\n        a key and a value.  Every key and value is serial bytes with\n        variable length.  Both binary data and character string can be used\n        as a key and a value.  There is neither concept of data tables nor\n        data types.  Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree, or\n        fixed-length array.\n\n        Tokyo Cabinet is developed as the successor of GDBM and QDBM on the\n        following purposes.  They are achieved and Tokyo Cabinet replaces\n        conventional DBM products: improves space efficiency, improves time\n        efficiency, improves parallelism, improves usability, improves\n        robustness, supports 64-bit architecture.\n","versionString":"1.4.48","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0+"},"versionNumberList":[1,4,48]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["tokyocabinet"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/tokyo-cabinet/default.nix:20","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
