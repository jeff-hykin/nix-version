{"frozen":{"name":"tokyocabinet","shortDescription":"Tokyo Cabinet: a modern implementation of DBM","longDescription":"Tokyo Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The\n        database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of\n        a key and a value.  Every key and value is serial bytes with\n        variable length.  Both binary data and character string can be used\n        as a key and a value.  There is neither concept of data tables nor\n        data types.  Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree, or\n        fixed-length array.\n\n        Tokyo Cabinet is developed as the successor of GDBM and QDBM on the\n        following purposes.  They are achieved and Tokyo Cabinet replaces\n        conventional DBM products: improves space efficiency, improves time\n        efficiency, improves parallelism, improves usability, improves\n        robustness, supports 64-bit architecture.\n","versionString":"1.4.48","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,4,48]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["tokyocabinet"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/tokyo-cabinet/default.nix:20","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"families":{"bsd":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"bsd"}}}},{"kernel":{"families":{"darwin":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"darwin"}}}},{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}},{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"solaris"}},{"abi":{"_type":"abi","name":"cygnus"},"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"pe"},"families":{},"name":"windows"}}]}}
