{"frozen":{"name":"tokyocabinet","shortDescription":"Tokyo Cabinet: a modern implementation of DBM","longDescription":"Tokyo Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The\n        database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of\n        a key and a value.  Every key and value is serial bytes with\n        variable length.  Both binary data and character string can be used\n        as a key and a value.  There is neither concept of data tables nor\n        data types.  Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree, or\n        fixed-length array.\n\n        Tokyo Cabinet is developed as the successor of GDBM and QDBM on the\n        following purposes.  They are achieved and Tokyo Cabinet replaces\n        conventional DBM products: improves space efficiency, improves time\n        efficiency, improves parallelism, improves usability, improves\n        robustness, supports 64-bit architecture.\n","versionString":"1.4.48","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,4,48]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["tokyocabinet"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/tokyo-cabinet/default.nix:21","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["tokyocabinet"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/tokyo-cabinet/default.nix:21","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-solaris","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox"]}}
