This is accomplished via a symlinking step and\nan innovative use of rsync to maintain back-up and synchronization\nbetween the two. One of the major design goals of psd is a completely\ntransparent user experience.\n","versionString":"profile-sync-daemon-v5.53","homepage":"https://github.com/graysky2/profile-sync-daemon","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT"},"versionNumberList":[5,53]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["profile-sync-daemon"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/profile-sync-daemon/default.nix:17","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
