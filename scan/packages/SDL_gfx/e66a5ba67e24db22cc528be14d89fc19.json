{"frozen":{"name":"SDL_gfx","shortDescription":"SDL graphics drawing primitives and support functions","longDescription":"The SDL_gfx library evolved out of the SDL_gfxPrimitives code\nwhich provided basic drawing routines such as lines, circles or\npolygons and SDL_rotozoom which implemented a interpolating\nrotozoomer for SDL surfaces.\n\nThe current components of the SDL_gfx library are:\n\n  * Graphic Primitives (SDL_gfxPrimitves.h)\n  * Rotozoomer (SDL_rotozoom.h)\n  * Framerate control (SDL_framerate.h)\n  * MMX image filters (SDL_imageFilter.h)\n  * Custom Blit functions (SDL_gfxBlitFunc.h)\n\nThe library is backwards compatible to the above mentioned\ncode. Its is written in plain C and can be used in C++ code.\n","versionString":"2.0.26","homepage":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/sdlgfx/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"zlib License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"zlib","spdxId":"Zlib","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/Zlib.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,0,26]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["SDL_gfx"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/SDL_gfx/default.nix:18","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["SDL_gfx"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/SDL_gfx/default.nix:18","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-solaris","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox"]}}
