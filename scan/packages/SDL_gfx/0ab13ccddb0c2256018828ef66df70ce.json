{"frozen":{"name":"SDL_gfx","shortDescription":"SDL graphics drawing primitives and support functions","longDescription":" The SDL_gfx library evolved out of the SDL_gfxPrimitives code\n\t which provided basic drawing routines such as lines, circles or\n\t polygons and SDL_rotozoom which implemented a interpolating\n\t rotozoomer for SDL surfaces.\n\n\t The current components of the SDL_gfx library are:\n\n\t    * Graphic Primitives (SDL_gfxPrimitves.h)\n\t    * Rotozoomer (SDL_rotozoom.h)\n\t    * Framerate control (SDL_framerate.h)\n\t    * MMX image filters (SDL_imageFilter.h)\n\t    * Custom Blit functions (SDL_gfxBlitFunc.h)\n\n\t The library is backwards compatible to the above mentioned\n         code. Its is written in plain C and can be used in C++ code.\n","versionString":"2.0.22","homepage":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/sdlgfx/","license":"LGPLv2+","versionNumberList":[2,0,22]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["SDL_gfx"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
