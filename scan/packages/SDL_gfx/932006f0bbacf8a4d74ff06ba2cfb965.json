{"frozen":{"name":"SDL_gfx","shortDescription":"SDL graphics drawing primitives and support functions","longDescription":" The SDL_gfx library evolved out of the SDL_gfxPrimitives code\n\t which provided basic drawing routines such as lines, circles or\n\t polygons and SDL_rotozoom which implemented a interpolating\n\t rotozoomer for SDL surfaces.\n\n\t The current components of the SDL_gfx library are:\n\n\t    * Graphic Primitives (SDL_gfxPrimitves.h)\n\t    * Rotozoomer (SDL_rotozoom.h)\n\t    * Framerate control (SDL_framerate.h)\n\t    * MMX image filters (SDL_imageFilter.h)\n\t    * Custom Blit functions (SDL_gfxBlitFunc.h)\n\n\t The library is backwards compatible to the above mentioned\n         code. Its is written in plain C and can be used in C++ code.\n","versionString":"2.0.25","homepage":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/sdlgfx/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0+"},"versionNumberList":[2,0,25]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["SDL_gfx"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/SDL_gfx/default.nix:23","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
