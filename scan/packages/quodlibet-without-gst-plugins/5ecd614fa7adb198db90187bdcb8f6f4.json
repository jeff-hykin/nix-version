It lets you display and edit any\ntags you want in the file. And it lets you do this for all the\nfile formats it supports. Quod Libet easily scales to libraries\nof thousands (or even tens of thousands) of songs. It also\nsupports most of the features you expect from a modern media\nplayer, like Unicode support, tag editing, Replay Gain, podcasts\n& internet radio, and all major audio formats.\n","versionString":"4.4.0","homepage":"https://quodlibet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[4,4,0]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["quodlibet-without-gst-plugins"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/quodlibet/default.nix:66","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["quodlibet-without-gst-plugins"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/quodlibet/default.nix:66","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin"]}}
