{"frozen":{"name":"sooperlooper-git","shortDescription":"A live looping sampler capable of immediate loop recording, overdubbing, multiplying, reversing and more","longDescription":"It allows for multiple simultaneous multi-channel loops limited only by your computer's available memory.\nThe application is a standalone JACK client with an engine controllable via OSC and MIDI.\nIt also includes a GUI which communicates with the engine via OSC (even over a network) for user-friendly control on a desktop.\nHowever, this kind of live performance looping tool is most effectively used via hardware (midi footpedals, etc)\nand the engine can be run standalone on a computer without a monitor.\n","versionString":"2016-07-19","homepage":"http://essej.net/sooperlooper/index.html","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["sooperlooper"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/sooperlooper/default.nix:30","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
