{"frozen":{"name":"gzip","shortDescription":"Gzip, the GNU zip compression program","longDescription":"gzip (GNU zip) is a popular data compression program written by\n        Jean-loup Gailly for the GNU project.  Mark Adler wrote the\n        decompression part.\n\n        We developed this program as a replacement for compress because of\n        the Unisys and IBM patents covering the LZW algorithm used by\n        compress.  These patents made it impossible for us to use compress,\n        and we needed a replacement.  The superior compression ratio of gzip\n        is just a bonus.\n","versionString":"1.5","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/","license":"GPLv3+","versionNumberList":[1,5]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["gzip"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}]}}
