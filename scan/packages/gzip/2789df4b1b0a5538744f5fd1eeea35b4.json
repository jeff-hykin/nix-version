{"frozen":{"name":"gzip","shortDescription":"GNU zip compression program","longDescription":"gzip (GNU zip) is a popular data compression program written by\n        Jean-loup Gailly for the GNU project.  Mark Adler wrote the\n        decompression part.\n\n        We developed this program as a replacement for compress because of\n        the Unisys and IBM patents covering the LZW algorithm used by\n        compress.  These patents made it impossible for us to use compress,\n        and we needed a replacement.  The superior compression ratio of gzip\n        is just a bonus.\n","versionString":"1.6","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0+"},"versionNumberList":[1,6]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["gzip"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/compression/gzip/default.nix:22","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
