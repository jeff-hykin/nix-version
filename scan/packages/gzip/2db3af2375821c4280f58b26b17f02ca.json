{"frozen":{"name":"gzip","shortDescription":"GNU zip compression program","longDescription":"gzip (GNU zip) is a popular data compression program written by\n        Jean-loup Gailly for the GNU project.  Mark Adler wrote the\n        decompression part.\n\n        We developed this program as a replacement for compress because of\n        the Unisys and IBM patents covering the LZW algorithm used by\n        compress.  These patents made it impossible for us to use compress,\n        and we needed a replacement.  The superior compression ratio of gzip\n        is just a bonus.\n","versionString":"1.10","homepage":"https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,10]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["gzip"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/compression/gzip/default.nix:22","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
