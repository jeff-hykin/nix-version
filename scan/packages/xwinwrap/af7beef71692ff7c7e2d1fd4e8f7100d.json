{"frozen":{"name":"xwinwrap","shortDescription":"A utility that allows you to use an animated X window as the wallpaper","longDescription":"XWinWrap is a small utility written a loooong time ago that allowed you to\nstick most of the apps to your desktop background. What this meant was you\ncould use an animated screensaver (like glmatrix, electric sheep, etc) or\neven a movie, and use it as your wallpaper. But only one version of this\napp was ever released, and it had a few problems, like:\n\n- Well, sticking didn’t work. So if you did a “minimize all” or “go to\ndesktop” kind of thing, your “wallpaper” got minimized as well.\n\n- The geometry option didn’t work, so you could not create, e.g., a small\nmatrix window surrounded by your original wallpaper.\n\nSeeing no-one picking it up, I decided to give it a bit of polish last\nweekend by fixing the above problems and also add a few features. And here\nit is, in its new avatar “Shantz XWinWrap”.\n","versionString":"4","homepage":"https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/03/shantz-xwinwrap/","license":{"fullName":"Historic Permission Notice and Disclaimer","shortName":"hpnd","spdxId":"HPND","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/HPND.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["xwinwrap"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/X11/xwinwrap/default.nix:31","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
