{"frozen":{"name":"xwinwrap","shortDescription":"A utility that allows you to use an animated X window as the wallpaper","longDescription":"XWinWrap is a small utility written a loooong time ago that allowed you to\nstick most of the apps to your desktop background. What this meant was you\ncould use an animated screensaver (like glmatrix, electric sheep, etc) or\neven a movie, and use it as your wallpaper. But only one version of this\napp was ever released, and it had a few problems, like:\n\n- Well, sticking didn’t work. So if you did a “minimize all” or “go to\ndesktop” kind of thing, your “wallpaper” got minimized as well.\n\n- The geometry option didn’t work, so you could not create, e.g., a small\nmatrix window surrounded by your original wallpaper.\n\nSeeing no-one picking it up, I decided to give it a bit of polish last\nweekend by fixing the above problems and also add a few features. And here\nit is, in its new avatar “Shantz XWinWrap”.\n","versionString":"4","homepage":"https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/03/shantz-xwinwrap/","license":{"fullName":"Historic Permission Notice and Disclaimer","shortName":"hpnd","spdxId":"HPND","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/HPND.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["xwinwrap"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/X11/xwinwrap/default.nix:32","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["xwinwrap"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/X11/xwinwrap/default.nix:32","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
