{"frozen":{"name":"ncurses","shortDescription":"Free software emulation of curses in SVR4 and more","longDescription":"The Ncurses (new curses) library is a free software emulation of\ncurses in System V Release 4.0, and more.  It uses Terminfo\nformat, supports pads and color and multiple highlights and\nforms characters and function-key mapping, and has all the other\nSYSV-curses enhancements over BSD Curses.\n\nThe ncurses code was developed under GNU/Linux.  It has been in\nuse for some time with OpenBSD as the system curses library, and\non FreeBSD and NetBSD as an external package.  It should port\neasily to any ANSI/POSIX-conforming UNIX.  It has even been\nported to OS/2 Warp!\n","versionString":"6.2-abi5-compat","homepage":"https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[6,2,"-abi5-compat"]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["ncurses5"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/ncurses/default.nix:152","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["ncurses5"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/ncurses/default.nix:152","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-windows","i686-windows","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","arm-none","armv6l-none","aarch64-none","avr-none","i686-none","x86_64-none","powerpc-none","msp430-none","riscv64-none","riscv32-none","vc4-none","or1k-none","mmix-mmixware","js-ghcjs","aarch64-genode","i686-genode","x86_64-genode"]}}
