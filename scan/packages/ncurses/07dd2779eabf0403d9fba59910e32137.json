It uses Terminfo\nformat, supports pads and color and multiple highlights and\nforms characters and function-key mapping, and has all the other\nSYSV-curses enhancements over BSD Curses.\n\nThe ncurses code was developed under GNU/Linux.  It has been in\nuse for some time with OpenBSD as the system curses library, and\non FreeBSD and NetBSD as an external package.  It should port\neasily to any ANSI/POSIX-conforming UNIX.  It has even been\nported to OS/2 Warp!\n","versionString":"6.1-20190112","homepage":"https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[6,1,"-20190112"]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["ncurses6"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/ncurses/default.nix:151","date":"2019-03-01"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["ncurses"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/ncurses/default.nix:151","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
