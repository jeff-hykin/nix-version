It uses Terminfo\nformat, supports pads and color and multiple highlights and\nforms characters and function-key mapping, and has all the other\nSYSV-curses enhancements over BSD Curses.\n\nThe ncurses code was developed under GNU/Linux.  It has been in\nuse for some time with OpenBSD as the system curses library, and\non FreeBSD and NetBSD as an external package.  It should port\neasily to any ANSI/POSIX-conforming UNIX.  It has even been\nported to OS/2 Warp!\n","versionString":"5.9","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT"},"versionNumberList":[5,9]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["ncurses"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/ncurses/default.nix:90","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
