Its highly optimized\nexecution algorithm delivers efficiency far in excess of existing logic\nprogramming systems, and close to conventional programming systems.\nMercury addresses the problems of large-scale program development,\nallowing modularity, separate compilation, and numerous optimization/time\ntrade-offs.\n","versionString":"14.01.1","homepage":"http://mercurylang.org","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0"},"versionNumberList":[14,1,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["mercury"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/compilers/mercury/default.nix:46","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
