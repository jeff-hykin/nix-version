{"frozen":{"name":"ed","shortDescription":"An implementation of the standard Unix editor","longDescription":"GNU ed is a line-oriented text editor.  It is used to create,\ndisplay, modify and otherwise manipulate text files, both\ninteractively and via shell scripts.  A restricted version of ed,\nred, can only edit files in the current directory and cannot\nexecute shell commands.  Ed is the \"standard\" text editor in the\nsense that it is the original editor for Unix, and thus widely\navailable.  For most purposes, however, it is superseded by\nfull-screen editors such as GNU Emacs or GNU Moe.\n","versionString":"1.17","homepage":"https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,17]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["ed"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/editors/ed/default.nix:23","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
