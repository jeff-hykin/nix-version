{"frozen":{"name":"xen","shortDescription":"Xen hypervisor and related components (vanilla)","longDescription":"Vanilla version of Xen. Uses forks of Qemu and Seabios bundled\nwith Xen. This gives vanilla experince, but wastes space and\nbuild time: typical NixOS setup that runs lots of VMs will\nbuild three different versions of Qemu when using this (two\nforks and upstream).\n\nIncludes:\n* firmware/etherboot/ipxe.git: Xen's fork of iPXE.\n* firmware/seabios-dir-remote: Xen's fork of Seabios.\n* qemu-xen: Xen's fork of upstream Qemu.\n* qemu-xen-traditional: Xen's fork of upstream Qemu that uses old device model.\n* xen-libhvm-dir-remote: Helper library for reading ACPI and SMBIOS firmware values\nfrom the host system for use with the HVM guest firmware\npass-through feature in Xen.","versionString":"4.8.3","homepage":"http://www.xen.org/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[4,8,3]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["xen"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/virtualization/xen/generic.nix:230","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":["x86_64-linux"]}}
