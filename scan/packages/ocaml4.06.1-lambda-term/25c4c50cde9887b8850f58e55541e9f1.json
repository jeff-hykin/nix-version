It provides an abstraction for keys,\nmouse events, colors, as well as a set of widgets to write\ncurses-like applications.\n\nThe main objective of lambda-term is to provide a higher level\nfunctional interface to terminal manipulation than, for example,\nncurses, by providing a native OCaml interface instead of bindings to\na C library.\n\nLambda-term integrates with zed to provide text edition facilities in\nconsole applications.\n","versionString":"1.13","homepage":"https://github.com/diml/lambda-term","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,13]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["ocamlPackages","lambdaTerm"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/ocaml-modules/lambda-term/default.nix:19","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}},{"kernel":{"families":{"darwin":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"darwin"}}}}]}}
