{"frozen":{"name":"sakura","shortDescription":"A terminal emulator based on GTK and VTE","longDescription":"sakura is a terminal emulator based on GTK and VTE. It's a terminal\nemulator with few dependencies, so you don't need a full GNOME desktop\ninstalled to have a decent terminal emulator. Current terminal emulators\nbased on VTE are gnome-terminal, XFCE Terminal, TermIt and a small\nsample program included in the vte sources. The differences between\nsakura and the last one are that it uses a notebook to provide several\nterminals in one window and adds a contextual menu with some basic\noptions. No more no less.\n","versionString":"3.8.4","homepage":"https://www.pleyades.net/david/projects/sakura","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2Only","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,8,4]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["sakura"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/terminal-emulators/sakura/default.nix:48","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
