{"frozen":{"name":"mr","shortDescription":"Multiple Repository management tool","longDescription":"The mr(1) command can checkout, update, or perform other actions on a\n      set of repositories as if they were one combined respository. It\n      supports any combination of subversion, git, cvs, mercurial, bzr,\n      darcs, cvs, vcsh, fossil and veracity repositories, and support for\n      other revision control systems can easily be added. (There are\n      extensions adding support for unison and git-svn.)\n\n      It is extremely configurable via simple shell scripting. Some examples\n      of things it can do include:\n\n        - Update a repository no more frequently than once every twelve\n          hours.\n        - Run an arbitrary command before committing to a\n          repository.\n        - When updating a git repository, pull from two\n          different upstreams and merge the two together.\n        - Run several repository updates in parallel, greatly speeding\n          up the update process.\n        - Remember actions that failed due to a laptop being\n          offline, so they can be retried when it comes back online.\n","versionString":"1.13","homepage":"http://joeyh.name/code/mr/","license":"GPLv2+","versionNumberList":[1,13]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["mr"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","powerpc-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
