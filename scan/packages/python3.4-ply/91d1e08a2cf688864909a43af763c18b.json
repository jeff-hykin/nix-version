{"frozen":{"name":"python3.4-ply","shortDescription":"PLY (Python Lex-Yacc), an implementation of the lex and yacc parsing tools for Python","longDescription":"PLY is an implementation of lex and yacc parsing tools for Python.\nIn a nutshell, PLY is nothing more than a straightforward lex/yacc\nimplementation.  Here is a list of its essential features: It's\nimplemented entirely in Python; It uses LR-parsing which is\nreasonably efficient and well suited for larger grammars; PLY\nprovides most of the standard lex/yacc features including support for\nempty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support for\nambiguous grammars; PLY is straightforward to use and provides very\nextensive error checking; PLY doesn't try to do anything more or less\nthan provide the basic lex/yacc functionality.  In other words, it's\nnot a large parsing framework or a component of some larger system.\n","versionString":"3.4","homepage":"http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause"},"versionNumberList":[3,4]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["python34Packages","ply"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/top-level/python-packages.nix:8828","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin"]}}
