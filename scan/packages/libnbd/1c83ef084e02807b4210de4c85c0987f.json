This is the NBD client\nlibrary in userspace, a simple library for writing NBD clients.\n\nThe key features are:\n- Synchronous API for ease of use.\n- Asynchronous API for writing non-blocking, multithreaded clients. You\n  can mix both APIs freely.\n- High performance.\n- Minimal dependencies for the basic library.\n- Well-documented, stable API.\n- Bindings in several programming languages.\n- Shell (nbdsh) for command line and scripting.\n","versionString":"1.9.5","homepage":"https://gitlab.com/nbdkit/libnbd","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"lgpl21Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,9,5]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["libnbd"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/libnbd/default.nix:37","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["libnbd"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/libnbd/default.nix:37","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
