{"frozen":{"name":"gravit","shortDescription":"Beautiful OpenGL-based gravity simulator","longDescription":"Gravit is a gravity simulator which runs under Linux, Windows and\nmacOS. It uses Newtonian physics using the Barnes-Hut N-body\nalgorithm. Although the main goal of Gravit is to be as accurate\nas possible, it also creates beautiful looking gravity patterns.\nIt records the history of each particle so it can animate and\ndisplay a path of its travels. At any stage you can rotate your\nview in 3D and zoom in and out.\n","versionString":"0.5.1","homepage":"https://gravit.slowchop.com","license":{"deprecated":true,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,5,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["gravit"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/astronomy/gravit/default.nix:26","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["gravit"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/astronomy/gravit/default.nix:27","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","x86_64-darwin","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","armv7a-linux","aarch64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","aarch64-darwin","riscv64-linux"]}}
