{"frozen":{"name":"gravit","shortDescription":"Beautiful OpenGL-based gravity simulator","longDescription":"Gravit is a gravity simulator which runs under Linux, Windows and\nMac OS X. It uses Newtonian physics using the Barnes-Hut N-body\nalgorithm. Although the main goal of Gravit is to be as accurate\nas possible, it also creates beautiful looking gravity patterns.\nIt records the history of each particle so it can animate and\ndisplay a path of its travels. At any stage you can rotate your\nview in 3D and zoom in and out.\n","versionString":"0.5.1","homepage":"http://gravit.slowchop.com","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0"},"versionNumberList":[0,5,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["gravit"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/astronomy/gravit/default.nix:17","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","x86_64-darwin","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux"]}}
