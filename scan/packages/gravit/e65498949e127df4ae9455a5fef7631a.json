{"frozen":{"name":"gravit","shortDescription":"A beautiful OpenGL-based gravity simulator","longDescription":"Gravit is a gravity simulator which runs under Linux, Windows and\nMac OS X. It uses Newtonian physics using the Barnes-Hut N-body\nalgorithm. Although the main goal of Gravit is to be as accurate\nas possible, it also creates beautiful looking gravity patterns.\nIt records the history of each particle so it can animate and\ndisplay a path of its travels. At any stage you can rotate your\nview in 3D and zoom in and out.\n","versionString":"0.5.0","homepage":"http://gravit.slowchop.com","license":"GPLv2","versionNumberList":[0,5,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["gravit"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","x86_64-darwin","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux"]}}
