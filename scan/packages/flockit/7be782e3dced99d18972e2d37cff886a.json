{"frozen":{"name":"flockit","shortDescription":"LD_PRELOAD shim to add file locking to programs that don't do it (I'm looking at you, rsync!)","longDescription":"This library and tool exists solely because rsync doesn't have file locking.\n\nIt's not used like a normal library; you don't link against it, and you\ndon't have to patch your source code to use it. It's inserted between your\nprogram and its libraries by use of LD_PRELOAD.\n\nFor example:\n\n  $ env LD_PRELOAD=$(nix-build -A pkgs.flockit)/lib/libflockit.so FLOCKIT_FILE_PREFIX=test rsync SRC DEST\n\nBesides the library a handy executable is provided which can simplify the above to:\n\n  $ $(nix-build -A pkgs.flockit)/bin/flockit test rsync SRC DEST\n\nAlso see the following blog post:\nhttps://www.swiftstack.com/blog/2012/08/15/old-school-monkeypatching/\n","versionString":"2012-08-11","homepage":"https://github.com/smerritt/flockit","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"Apache License 2.0","redistributable":true,"shortName":"asl20","spdxId":"Apache-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["flockit"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/backup/flockit/default.nix:27","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["flockit"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/backup/flockit/default.nix:27","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
