{"frozen":{"name":"flockit","shortDescription":"LD_PRELOAD shim to add file locking to programs that don't do it (I'm looking at you, rsync!)","longDescription":"This library and tool exists solely because rsync doesn't have file locking.\n\nIt's not used like a normal library; you don't link against it, and you\ndon't have to patch your source code to use it. It's inserted between your\nprogram and its libraries by use of LD_PRELOAD.\n\nFor example:\n\n  $ env LD_PRELOAD=$(nix-build -A pkgs.flockit)/lib/libflockit.so FLOCKIT_FILE_PREFIX=test rsync SRC DEST\n\nBesides the library a handy executable is provided which can simplify the above to:\n\n  $ $(nix-build -A pkgs.flockit)/bin/flockit test rsync SRC DEST\n\nAlso see the following blog post:\nhttps://www.swiftstack.com/blog/2012/08/15/old-school-monkeypatching/\n","versionString":"2012-08-11","homepage":"https://github.com/smerritt/flockit","license":{"fullName":"Apache License 2.0","shortName":"asl20","spdxId":"Apache-2.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["flockit"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/backup/flockit/default.nix:27","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
