Smooth alpha-blended\nslide transitions are provided for the sake of eye candy, but\nin addition to this, Impressive offers some unique tools that\nare really useful for presentations.  Read below if you want\nto know more about these features.\n\nCreating presentations for Impressive is very simple: You just\nneed to export a PDF file from your presentation software.\nThis means that you can create slides in the application of\nyour choice and use Impressive for displaying them.  If your\napplication does not support PDF output, you can alternatively\nuse a set of pre-rendered image files â€“ or you use Impressive\nto make a slideshow with your favorite photos.\n","versionString":"0.12.1","homepage":"http://impressive.sourceforge.net/","license":{"deprecated":true,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,12,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["impressive"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/office/impressive/default.nix:43","date":"2021-10-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","x86_64-darwin","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","armv7a-linux","aarch64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","aarch64-darwin","riscv64-linux"]}}
