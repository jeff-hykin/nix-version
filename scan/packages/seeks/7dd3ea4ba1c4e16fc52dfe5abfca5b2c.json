{"frozen":{"name":"seeks","shortDescription":"Seeks, a social web search engine","longDescription":"Seeks is a free and open technical design and application for\n        enabling social websearch.  Its specific purpose is to regroup users\n        whose queries are similar so they can share both the query results\n        and their experience on these results.  On this basis, Seeks allows\n        for true real-time, decentralized, websearch to emerge.\n\n        In the long term, there is no need for web crawlers and third-party\n        web indexes as users can push content directly to search groups.\n","versionString":"0.4.1","homepage":"http://www.seeks-project.info/","license":"AGPLv3+","versionNumberList":[0,4,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["seeks"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
