{"frozen":{"name":"keyfinder","shortDescription":"Musical key detection for digital audio (graphical UI)","longDescription":"KeyFinder is an open source key detection tool, for DJs interested in\nharmonic and tonal mixing. Designed primarily for electronic and dance\nmusic, it is highly configurable and can be applied to many genres. It\nsupports a huge range of codecs thanks to LibAV, and writes to metadata\ntags using TagLib. It's intended to be very focused: no library\nmanagement, no track suggestions, no media player. Just a fast,\nefficient workflow tool.\n","versionString":"2.4","homepage":"http://www.ibrahimshaath.co.uk/keyfinder/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,4]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["keyfinder"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/keyfinder/default.nix:26","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["keyfinder"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/keyfinder/default.nix:26","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
