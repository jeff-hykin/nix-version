Designed primarily for electronic and dance\nmusic, it is highly configurable and can be applied to many genres. It\nsupports a huge range of codecs thanks to LibAV, and writes to metadata\ntags using TagLib. It's intended to be very focused: no library\nmanagement, no track suggestions, no media player. Just a fast,\nefficient workflow tool.\n","versionString":"2.2","homepage":"http://www.ibrahimshaath.co.uk/keyfinder/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["keyfinder"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/keyfinder/default.nix:27","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
