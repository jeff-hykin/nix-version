Designed primarily for electronic and dance\nmusic, it is highly configurable and can be applied to many genres. It\nsupports a huge range of codecs thanks to LibAV, and writes to metadata\ntags using TagLib. It's intended to be very focused: no library\nmanagement, no track suggestions, no media player. Just a fast,\nefficient workflow tool.\n","versionString":"2.00","homepage":"http://www.ibrahimshaath.co.uk/keyfinder/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0+"},"versionNumberList":[2,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["keyfinder"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/keyfinder/default.nix:16","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
