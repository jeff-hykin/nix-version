Designed primarily for electronic and dance\nmusic, it is highly configurable and can be applied to many genres. It\nsupports a huge range of codecs thanks to LibAV, and writes to metadata\ntags using TagLib. It's intended to be very focused: no library\nmanagement, no track suggestions, no media player. Just a fast,\nefficient workflow tool.\n","versionString":"2.2","homepage":"http://www.ibrahimshaath.co.uk/keyfinder/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["keyfinder"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/keyfinder/default.nix:27","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
