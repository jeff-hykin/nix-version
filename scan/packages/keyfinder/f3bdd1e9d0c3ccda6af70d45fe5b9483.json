Designed primarily for electronic and dance\nmusic, it is highly configurable and can be applied to many genres. It\nsupports a huge range of codecs thanks to LibAV, and writes to metadata\ntags using TagLib. It's intended to be very focused: no library\nmanagement, no track suggestions, no media player. Just a fast,\nefficient workflow tool.\n","versionString":"2.4","homepage":"http://www.ibrahimshaath.co.uk/keyfinder/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,4]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["keyfinder"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/keyfinder/default.nix:26","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
