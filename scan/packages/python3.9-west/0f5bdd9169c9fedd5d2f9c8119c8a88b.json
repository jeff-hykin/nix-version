{"frozen":{"name":"python3.9-west","shortDescription":"Zephyr RTOS meta tool","longDescription":"West lets you manage multiple Git repositories under a single directory using a single file,\ncalled the west manifest file, or manifest for short.\n\nThe manifest file is named west.yml.\nYou use west init to set up this directory,\nthen west update to fetch and/or update the repositories\nnamed in the manifest.\n\nBy default, west uses upstream Zephyr’s manifest file\n(https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/master/west.yml),\nbut west doesn’t care if the manifest repository is a Zephyr tree or not.\n\nFor more details, see Multiple Repository Management in the west documentation\n(https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/west/repo-tool.html).\n","versionString":"0.8.0","homepage":"https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/west","license":{"fullName":"Apache License 2.0","shortName":"asl20","spdxId":"Apache-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,8,0]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["python39Packages","west"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/python-modules/west/default.nix:33","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin"]}}
