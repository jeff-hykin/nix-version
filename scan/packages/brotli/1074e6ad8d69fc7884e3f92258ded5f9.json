{"frozen":{"name":"brotli","shortDescription":"A generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm and tool","longDescription":"Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that\n        compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77\n        algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a\n        compression ratio comparable to the best currently available\n        general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with\n        deflate but offers more dense compression.\n\n        The specification of the Brotli Compressed Data Format is defined\n        in the following internet draft:\n        http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-alakuijala-brotli\n","versionString":"1.0.7","homepage":"https://github.com/google/brotli","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,0,7]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["brotli"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/compression/brotli/default.nix:41","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
