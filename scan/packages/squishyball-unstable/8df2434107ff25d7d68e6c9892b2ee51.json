{"frozen":{"name":"squishyball-unstable","shortDescription":"A tool to perform sample comparison testing on the command line","longDescription":"squishyball is a simple command-line utility for performing\ndouble-blind A/B, A/B/X or X/X/Y testing on the command line.\nThe user specifies two input files to be compared and uses the\nkeyboard during playback to flip between the randomized samples\nto perform on-the-fly compar‚Äê isons.  After a predetermined\nnumber of trials, squishyball prints the trial results to\nstdout and exits.  Results (stdout) may be redirected to a file\nwithout affecting interactive use of the terminal.\n\nsquishyball can also be used to perform casual, non-randomized\ncomparisons of groups of up to ten samples; this is the default\nmode of operation.\n","versionString":"2020-11-23","homepage":"https://gitlab.xiph.org/xiph/squishyball","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["squishyball"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/audio/squishyball/default.nix:40","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
