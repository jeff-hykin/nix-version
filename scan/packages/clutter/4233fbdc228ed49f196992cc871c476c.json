{"frozen":{"name":"clutter","shortDescription":"Library for creating fast, dynamic graphical user interfaces","longDescription":"Clutter is free software library for creating fast, compelling,\n        portable, and dynamic graphical user interfaces.  It is a core part\n        of MeeGo, and is supported by the open source community.  Its\n        development is sponsored by Intel.\n\n        Clutter uses OpenGL for rendering (and optionally OpenGL|ES for use\n        on mobile and embedded platforms), but wraps an easy to use,\n        efficient, flexible API around GL's complexity.\n\n        Clutter enforces no particular user interface style, but provides a\n        rich, generic foundation for higher-level toolkits tailored to\n        specific needs.\n","versionString":"1.16.2","homepage":"http://www.clutter-project.org/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0+"},"versionNumberList":[1,16,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["clutter"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/clutter/default.nix:29","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","x86_64-darwin","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux"]}}
