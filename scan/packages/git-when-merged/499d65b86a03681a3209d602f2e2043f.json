{"frozen":{"name":"git-when-merged","shortDescription":"Helps you figure out when and why a commit was merged into a branch","longDescription":"If you use standard Git workflows, then you create a feature\nbranch for each feature that you are working on. When the feature\nis complete, you merge it into your master branch. You might even\nhave sub-feature branches that are merged into a feature branch\nbefore the latter is merged.\n\nIn such a workflow, the first-parent history of master consists\nmainly of merges of feature branches into the mainline. git\nwhen-merged can be used to ask, \"When (and why) was commit C\nmerged into the current branch?\"\n","versionString":"1.2.0","homepage":"https://github.com/mhagger/git-when-merged","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2Only","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,2,0]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["git-when-merged"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/version-management/git-and-tools/git-when-merged/default.nix:21","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin"]}}
