{"frozen":{"name":"tecoc-unstable","shortDescription":"A clone of the good old TECO editor","longDescription":"For those who don't know: TECO is the acronym of Tape Editor and COrrector\n(because it was a paper tape edition tool in its debut days). Now the\nacronym follows after Text Editor and Corrector, or Text Editor\nCharacter-Oriented.\n\nTECO is a character-oriented text editor, originally developed by Dan\nMurphy at MIT circa 1962. It is also a Turing-complete imperative\ninterpreted programming language for text manipulation, done via\nuser-loaded sets of macros. In fact, the venerable Emacs was born as a set\nof Editor MACroS for TECO.\n\nTECOC is a portable C implementation of TECO-11.\n","versionString":"2020-11-03","homepage":"https://github.com/blakemcbride/TECOC","license":{"url":"https://github.com/blakemcbride/TECOC/tree/master/doc/readme-1st.txt"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["tecoc"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/editors/tecoc/default.nix:53","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["tecoc"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/editors/tecoc/default.nix:53","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["tecoc"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/editors/tecoc/default.nix:53","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
