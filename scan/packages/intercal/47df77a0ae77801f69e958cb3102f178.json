{"frozen":{"name":"intercal","shortDescription":"The original esoteric programming language","longDescription":"INTERCAL, an abbreviation for \"Compiler Language With No\nPronounceable Acronym\", is a famously esoterical programming\nlanguage. It was created in 1972, by Donald R. Woods and James\nM. Lyon, with the unusual goal of creating a language with no\nsimilarities whatsoever to any existing programming\nlanguages. The language largely succeeds in this goal, apart\nfrom its use of an assignment statement.\n","versionString":"0.31","homepage":"http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,31]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["intercal"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/compilers/intercal/default.nix:26","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["intercal"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/compilers/intercal/default.nix:26","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
