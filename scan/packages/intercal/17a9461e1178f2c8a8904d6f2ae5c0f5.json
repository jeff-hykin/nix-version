{"frozen":{"name":"intercal","shortDescription":"The original esoteric programming language","longDescription":"INTERCAL, an abbreviation for \"Compiler Language With No\nPronounceable Acronym\", is a famously esoterical programming\nlanguage. It was created in 1972, by Donald R. Woods and James\nM. Lyon, with the unusual goal of creating a language with no\nsimilarities whatsoever to any existing programming\nlanguages. The language largely succeeds in this goal, apart\nfrom its use of an assignment statement.\n","versionString":"0.30","homepage":"http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,30]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["intercal"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/compilers/intercal/default.nix:26","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
