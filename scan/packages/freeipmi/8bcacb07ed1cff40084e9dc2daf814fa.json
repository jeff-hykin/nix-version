{"frozen":{"name":"freeipmi","shortDescription":"Implementation of the Intelligent Platform Management Interface","longDescription":"GNU FreeIPMI provides in-band and out-of-band IPMI software based on\n        the IPMI v1.5/2.0 specification.  The IPMI specification defines a\n        set of interfaces for platform management and is implemented by a\n        number vendors for system management.  The features of IPMI that\n        most users will be interested in are sensor monitoring, system event\n        monitoring, power control, and serial-over-LAN (SOL).  The FreeIPMI\n        tools and libraries listed below should provide users with the\n        ability to access and utilize these and many other features.  A\n        number of useful features for large HPC or cluster environments have\n        also been implemented into FreeIPMI. See the README or FAQ for more\n        info.\n","versionString":"1.6.7","homepage":"https://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,6,7]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["freeipmi"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/system/freeipmi/default.nix:17","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","powerpc64-linux","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
