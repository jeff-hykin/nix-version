{"frozen":{"name":"softhsm","shortDescription":"Cryptographic store accessible through a PKCS #11 interface","longDescription":"\n      SoftHSM provides a software implementation of a generic\n      cryptographic device with a PKCS#11 interface, which is of\n      course especially useful in environments where a dedicated hardware\n      implementation of such a device - for instance a Hardware\n      Security Module (HSM) or smartcard - is not available.\n\n      SoftHSM follows the OASIS PKCS#11 standard, meaning it should be\n      able to work with many cryptographic products. SoftHSM is a\n      programme of The Commons Conservancy.\n    ","versionString":"2.6.1","homepage":"https://www.opendnssec.org/softhsm","license":{"fullName":"BSD 2-clause \"Simplified\" License","shortName":"bsd2","spdxId":"BSD-2-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,6,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["softhsm"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/security/softhsm/default.nix:29","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
