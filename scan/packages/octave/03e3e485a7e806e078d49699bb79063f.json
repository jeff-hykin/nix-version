{"frozen":{"name":"octave","shortDescription":"Easily display results (boxes, pavings) from interval methods","longDescription":"The VIBes API allows one to easily display results (boxes, pavings) from\ninterval methods. VIBes consists in two parts: (1) the VIBes application\nthat features viewing, annotating and exporting figures, and (2) the\nVIBes API that enables your program to communicate with the viewer in order\nto draw figures. This package integrates the VIBes API into Octave. The\nVIBes application is required for operation and must be installed\nseperately. Data types from third-party interval arithmetic libraries for\nOctave are also supported.\n","versionString":"6.4.0-vibes-0.2.0","homepage":"https://octave.sourceforge.io/vibes/index.html","license":[{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"MIT License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"}],"versionNumberList":[6,4,0,"-vibes-0.2.0"]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":true,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["octavePackages","vibes"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/octave-modules/vibes/default.nix:24","date":"2022-01-31"}]}}
