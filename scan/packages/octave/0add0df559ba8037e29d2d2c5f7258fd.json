{"frozen":{"name":"octave","shortDescription":"Provides functions for queueing networks and Markov chains analysis","longDescription":"The queueing package provides functions for queueing networks and Markov\nchains analysis. This package can be used to compute steady-state\nperformance measures for open, closed and mixed networks with single or\nmultiple job classes. Mean Value Analysis (MVA), convolution, and various\nbounding techniques are implemented. Furthermore, several transient and\nsteady-state performance measures for Markov chains can be computed, such\nas state occupancy probabilities, mean time to absorption, time-averaged\nsojourn times and so forth. Discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains\nare supported.\n","versionString":"6.4.0-queueing-1.2.7","homepage":"https://octave.sourceforge.io/queueing/index.html","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[6,4,0,"-queueing-1.2.7"]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["octavePackages","queueing"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/octave-modules/queueing/default.nix:19","date":"2022-01-31"}]}}
