The applications it supports range from simple\nOgg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio\n(mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.\n\nApplications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter\ntechnology transparently.  Developers can add new codecs and\nfilters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic\ninterface.\n","versionString":"0.10.36","homepage":"http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0+"},"versionNumberList":[0,10,36]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["gstreamer"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/gstreamer/legacy/gstreamer/default.nix:42","date":"2015-08-08"}]}}
