{"frozen":{"name":"gstreamer","shortDescription":"Library for constructing graphs of media-handling components","longDescription":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling\ncomponents.  The applications it supports range from simple\nOgg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio\n(mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.\n\nApplications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter\ntechnology transparently.  Developers can add new codecs and\nfilters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic\ninterface.\n","versionString":"0.10.36","homepage":"https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org","license":{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 or later","shortName":"lgpl2Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,10,36]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["gstreamer"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/gstreamer/legacy/gstreamer/default.nix:72","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
