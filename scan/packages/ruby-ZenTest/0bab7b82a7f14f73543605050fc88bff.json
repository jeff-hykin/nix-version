{"frozen":{"name":"ruby-ZenTest","shortDescription":"ZenTest provides 4 different tools: zentest, unit_diff, autotest, and multiruby","longDescription":"ZenTest provides 4 different tools: zentest, unit_diff, autotest, and\nmultiruby.\n\nzentest scans your target and unit-test code and writes your missing\ncode based on simple naming rules, enabling XP at a much quicker pace.\nzentest only works with Ruby and Minitest or Test::Unit. There is\nenough evidence to show that this is still proving useful to users, so\nit stays.\n\nunit_diff is a command-line filter to diff expected results from\nactual results and allow you to quickly see exactly what is wrong.\nDo note that minitest 2.2+ provides an enhanced assert_equal obviating\nthe need for unit_diff\n\nautotest is a continous testing facility meant to be used during\ndevelopment. As soon as you save a file, autotest will run the\ncorresponding dependent tests.\n\nmultiruby runs anything you want on multiple versions of ruby. Great\nfor compatibility checking! Use multiruby_setup to manage your\ninstalled versions.","versionString":"4.9.3","homepage":"https://github.com/seattlerb/zentest","versionNumberList":[4,9,3]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["rubyLibs","ZenTest"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}]}}
