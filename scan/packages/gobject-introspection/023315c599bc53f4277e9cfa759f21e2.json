{"frozen":{"name":"gobject-introspection","shortDescription":"A middleware layer between C libraries and language bindings","longDescription":"GObject introspection is a middleware layer between C libraries (using\nGObject) and language bindings. The C library can be scanned at compile\ntime and generate a metadata file, in addition to the actual native C\nlibrary. Then at runtime, language bindings can read this metadata and\nautomatically provide bindings to call into the C library.\n","versionString":"1.64.1","homepage":"http://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection","license":[{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2 only","shortName":"lgpl2","spdxId":"LGPL-2.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-only.html"}],"versionNumberList":[1,64,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["gnome3","gobject-introspection"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/gobject-introspection/default.nix:78","date":"2020-05-05"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["gobjectIntrospection"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/gobject-introspection/default.nix:78","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
