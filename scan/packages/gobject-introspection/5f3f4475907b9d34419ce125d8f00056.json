The C library can be scanned at compile\ntime and generate a metadata file, in addition to the actual native C\nlibrary. Then at runtime, language bindings can read this metadata and\nautomatically provide bindings to call into the C library.\n","versionString":"1.36.0","homepage":"http://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection","versionNumberList":[1,36,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["gobjectIntrospection"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","powerpc-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
