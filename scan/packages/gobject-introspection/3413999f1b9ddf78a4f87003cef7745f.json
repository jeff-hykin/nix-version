The C library can be scanned at compile\ntime and generate a metadata file, in addition to the actual native C\nlibrary. Then at runtime, language bindings can read this metadata and\nautomatically provide bindings to call into the C library.\n","versionString":"1.44.0","homepage":"http://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection","versionNumberList":[1,44,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["gobjectIntrospection"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/gobject-introspection/default.nix:35","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
