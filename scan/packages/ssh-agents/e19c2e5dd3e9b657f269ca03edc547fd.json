{"frozen":{"name":"ssh-agents","shortDescription":"ssh-agents capable of spawning and maintaining multiple ssh-agents across terminals","longDescription":"The SSH agent is usually spawned by running eval $(ssh-agent), however this\nspawns a new SSH agent at every invocation. This project provides an\nssh-agent wrapper called ssh-agents that is capable of spawning an SSH\nagent and caching the environment variables for later invocation.\n\nFeatures\n- One SSH agent across all terminals\n- Add all un-encrypted SSH keys to the agent upon spawning. Please note\n  that encrypted SSH keys can only be added via ssh-add after having\n  started the agent.\n- Ability to have different keys in different agents for security purposes.\n- Multiple SSH agents\n- To use multi-SSH agents, start ssh agent with the --name flag. The\n  given name is expected to be a folder under ~/.ssh/name containing the\n  keys to include in the agent.\n","versionString":"1.0.1","homepage":"https://github.com/kalbasit/ssh-agents","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,0,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["ssh-agents"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/networking/ssh-agents/default.nix:20","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["ssh-agents"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/networking/ssh-agents/default.nix:20","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
