{"frozen":{"name":"ssh-agents","shortDescription":"ssh-agents capable of spawning and maintaining multiple ssh-agents across terminals","longDescription":"The SSH agent is usually spawned by running eval $(ssh-agent), however this\nspawns a new SSH agent at every invocation. This project provides an\nssh-agent wrapper called ssh-agents that is capable of spawning an SSH\nagent and caching the environment variables for later invocation.\n\nFeatures\n- One SSH agent across all terminals\n- Add all un-encrypted SSH keys to the agent upon spawning. Please note\n  that encrypted SSH keys can only be added via ssh-add after having\n  started the agent.\n- Ability to have different keys in different agents for security purposes.\n- Multiple SSH agents\n- To use multi-SSH agents, start ssh agent with the --name flag. The\n  given name is expected to be a folder under ~/.ssh/name containing the\n  keys to include in the agent.\n","versionString":"1.0.1","homepage":"https://github.com/kalbasit/ssh-agents","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,0,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["ssh-agents"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/networking/ssh-agents/default.nix:20","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"families":{"bsd":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"bsd"}}}},{"kernel":{"families":{"darwin":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"darwin"}}}},{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}},{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"solaris"}},{"abi":{"_type":"abi","name":"cygnus"},"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"pe"},"families":{},"name":"windows"}}]}}
