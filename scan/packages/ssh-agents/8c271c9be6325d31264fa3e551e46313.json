{"frozen":{"name":"ssh-agents","shortDescription":"ssh-agents capable of spawning and maintaining multiple ssh-agents across terminals","longDescription":"The SSH agent is usually spawned by running eval $(ssh-agent), however this\nspawns a new SSH agent at every invocation. This project provides an\nssh-agent wrapper called ssh-agents that is capable of spawning an SSH\nagent and caching the environment variables for later invocation.\n\nFeatures\n- One SSH agent across all terminals\n- Add all un-encrypted SSH keys to the agent upon spawning. Please note\n  that encrypted SSH keys can only be added via ssh-add after having\n  started the agent.\n- Ability to have different keys in different agents for security purposes.\n- Multiple SSH agents\n- To use multi-SSH agents, start ssh agent with the --name flag. The\n  given name is expected to be a folder under ~/.ssh/name containing the\n  keys to include in the agent.\n","versionString":"1.0.1","homepage":"https://github.com/kalbasit/ssh-agents","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"MIT License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,0,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["ssh-agents"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/networking/ssh-agents/default.nix:20","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["ssh-agents"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/networking/ssh-agents/default.nix:20","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-solaris","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox"]}}
