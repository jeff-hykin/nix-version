{"frozen":{"name":"open-watcom-v2-unwrapped-unstable","shortDescription":"The v2 fork of the Open Watcom suite of compilers and tools","longDescription":"A fork of Open Watcom: A C/C++/Fortran compiler and assembler suite\ntargeting a multitude of architectures (x86, IA-32, Alpha AXP, MIPS,\nPowerPC) and operating systems (DOS, OS/2, Windows, Linux).\n\nMain differences from Open Watcom 1.9:\n\n- New two-phase build system - Open Watcom can be built by the host's\n  native C/C++ compiler or by itself\n- Code generator properly initializes pointers by DLL symbol addresses\n- DOS tools now support long file names (LFN) if appropriate LFN driver\n  is loaded by DOS\n- Open Watcom is ported to 64-bit hosts (Win64, Linux x64)\n- Librarian supports x64 CPU object modules and libraries\n- RDOS 32-bit C run-time compact memory model libraries are fixed\n- Resource compiler and Resource editors support Win64 executables\n- Open Watcom text editor is now self-contained, it can be used as\n  standalone tool without any requirements for any additional files or\n  configuration\n- Broken C++ compiler pre-compiled header template support is fixed\n- Many C++ compiler crashes are fixed\n- Debugger has no length limit for any used environment variable\n\nThe documentation has been excluded from this build for build time reasons.
