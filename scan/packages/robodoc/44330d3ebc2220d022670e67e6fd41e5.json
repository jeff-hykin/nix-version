{"frozen":{"name":"robodoc","shortDescription":"Documentation Extraction Tool","longDescription":"ROBODoc is program documentation tool. The idea is to include for every\nfunction or procedure a standard header containing all sorts of\ninformation about the procedure or function. ROBODoc extracts these\nheaders from the source file and puts them in a separate\nautodocs-file. ROBODoc thus allows you to include the program\ndocumentation in the source code and avoid having to maintain two separate\ndocuments. Or as Petteri puts it: \"robodoc is very useful - especially for\nprogrammers who don't like writing documents with Word or some other\nstrange tool.\"\n\nROBODoc can format the headers in a number of different formats: HTML,\nRTF, LaTeX, or XML DocBook. In HTML mode it can generate cross links\nbetween headers. You can even include parts of your source code.\n\nROBODoc works with many programming languages: For instance C, Pascal,\nShell Scripts, Assembler, COBOL, Occam, Postscript, Forth, Tcl/Tk, C++,\nJava -- basically any program in which you can use remarks/comments.\n","versionString":"4.99.44","homepage":"https://github.com/gumpu/ROBODoc","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[4,99,44]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["robodoc"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/text/robodoc/default.nix:24","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["robodoc"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/text/robodoc/default.nix:24","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","aarch64-genode","i686-genode","x86_64-genode","x86_64-solaris","js-ghcjs","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","mmix-mmixware","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","aarch64-none","arm-none","armv6l-none","avr-none","i686-none","msp430-none","or1k-none","m68k-none","powerpc-none","riscv32-none","riscv64-none","s390-none","s390x-none","vc4-none","x86_64-none","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","x86_64-windows","i686-windows"]}}
