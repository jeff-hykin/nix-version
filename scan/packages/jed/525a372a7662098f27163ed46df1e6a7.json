{"frozen":{"name":"jed","shortDescription":"A programmable text editor written around S-Lang","longDescription":"JED is a freely available text editor for Unix, VMS, MSDOS, OS/2, BeOS,\nQNX, and win9X/NT platforms. Although it is a powerful editor designed for\nuse by programmers, its drop-down menu facility make it one of the\nfriendliest text editors around. Hence it is ideal for composing simple\nemail messages as well as editing complex programs in a variety of\ncomputer languages.\n\nJED makes extensive use of the S-Lang library, which endows it with the\npowerful S-Lang scripting language. Some of its features are:\n\n- Color syntax highlighting on color terminals, e.g., Linux console or a\n  remote color terminal via dialup (as well as Xjed)\n- Folding support\n- Drop-down menus on _ALL_ terminals/platforms\n- Emulation of Emacs, EDT, Wordstar, Borland, and Brief editors\n- Extensible in the C-like S-Lang language making the editor completely\n  customizable.\n- Capable of reading GNU info files from within JED's info browser\n- A variety of programming modes (with syntax highlighting) are available\n  including C, C++, FORTRAN, TeX, HTML, SH, python, IDL, DCL, NROFF...\n- Edit TeX files with AUC-TeX style editing (BiBTeX support too)\n- Asynchronous subprocess support allowing one to compile from within the\n  editor\n- Built-in support for the GPM mouse driver on Linux console\n- Abbreviation mode and Dynamic abbreviation mode\n- 8 bit clean with mute/dead key support\n- Supported on most Unix, VMS, OS/2, MSDOS (386+), win9X/NT, QNX, and BeOS\n  systems\n- Rectangular cut/paste; regular expressions; incremental searches; search\n  replace across multiple files; multiple windows; multiple buffers; shell\n  modes; directory editor (dired); mail; rmail; ispell; and much, much\n  more\n","versionString":"0.99-19","homepage":"https://www.jedsoft.org/jed/index.html","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,99,"-19"]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["jed"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/editors/jed/default.nix:55","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["jed"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/editors/jed/default.nix:55","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-solaris","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox"]}}
