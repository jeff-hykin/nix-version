On top of\nthat, a pluggable interface defines the I/O implementation for networking\n(send/receive RPC messages) and disk persistence (store log entries and\nsnapshots).\n","versionString":"0.9.18","homepage":"https://github.com/canonical/raft","license":{"fullName":"Apache License 2.0","shortName":"asl20","spdxId":"Apache-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,9,18]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["raft-canonical"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/raft-canonical/default.nix:32","date":"2020-05-05"}]}}
