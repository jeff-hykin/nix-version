{"frozen":{"name":"multitime","shortDescription":"Time command execution over multiple executions","longDescription":"Unix's `time` utility is a simple and often effective way of measuring\nhow long a command takes to run. Unfortunately, running a command once\ncan give misleading timings: the process may create a cache on its first\nexecution, running faster subsequently; other processes may cause the\ncommand to be starved of CPU or IO time; etc. It is common to see people\nrun `time` several times and take whichever values they feel most\ncomfortable with. Inevitably, this causes problems.\n\n`multitime` is, in essence, a simple extension to time which runs a\ncommand multiple times and prints the timing means (with confidence\nintervals), standard deviations, minimums, medians, and maximums having\ndone so. This can give a much better understanding of the command's\nperformance.\n","versionString":"1.4","homepage":"https://tratt.net/laurie/src/multitime/","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,4]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["multitime"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/multitime/default.nix:17","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["multitime"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/multitime/default.nix:17","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
