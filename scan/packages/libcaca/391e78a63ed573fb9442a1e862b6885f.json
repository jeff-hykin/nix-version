{"frozen":{"name":"libcaca","shortDescription":"A graphics library that outputs text instead of pixels","longDescription":"libcaca is a graphics library that outputs text instead of pixels, so that\nit can work on older video cards or text terminals. It is not unlike the\nfamous â€‹AAlib library, with the following improvements:\n\n- Unicode support\n- 2048 available colours (some devices can only handle 16)\n- dithering of colour images\n- advanced text canvas operations (blitting, rotations)\n\nLibcaca works in a text terminal (and should thus work on all Unix systems\nincluding Mac OS X) using the S-Lang or ncurses libraries. It also works\nnatively on DOS and Windows.\n\nLibcaca was written by Sam Hocevar and Jean-Yves Lamoureux.\n","versionString":"0.99.beta19","homepage":"http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/libcaca","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"Do What The F*ck You Want To Public License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"wtfpl","spdxId":"WTFPL","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/WTFPL.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,99,".beta19"]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["libcaca"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/libcaca/default.nix:54","date":"2021-10-20"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-solaris","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox"]}}
