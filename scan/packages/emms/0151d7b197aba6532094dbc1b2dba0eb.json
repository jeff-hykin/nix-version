Many of it's ideas are derived from\nMpthreePlayer, but it tries to be more general and cleaner.\n\nThe fact that EMMS is based on external players makes it\npowerful, because it supports all formats that those players\nsupport, with no effort from your side.\n","versionString":"3.0","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/emms/","license":"GPLv3+","versionNumberList":[3,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["emacs24Packages","emms"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
