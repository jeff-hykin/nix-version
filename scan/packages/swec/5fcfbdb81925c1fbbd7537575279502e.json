{"frozen":{"name":"swec","shortDescription":"Simple Web Error Checker (SWEC)","longDescription":"SWEC (Simple Web Error Checker) is a program that automates testing\n        of dynamic websites.  It parses each HTML file it finds for links,\n        and if those links are within the site specified (ie. local, not\n        external), it will check that page as well.  In this respect it\n        works a lot like a crawler, in that it'll click on any link it finds\n        (more notes about this later).\n\n        In addition to parsing and locating links, it will also parse the\n        pages looking for known errors and report those (such as Mason or\n        PHP errors), and will report if a page can not be read (by either\n        returning a 404, 500 or similar).\n\n        Since you may often want SWEC to be logged in on your site, you have\n        to be careful.  When logged in, SWEC will still click on all links\n        it finds, including things like 'join group' or 'delete account'\n        (though it has some magic trying to avoid the latter).  Therefore it\n        is highly recommended that when you run SWEC as a logged-in user on\n        a site, use a test server, not the live one.\n\n        Running SWEC on a live site without being logged in as a user is\n        perfectly fine, it won't do anything a normal crawler wouldn't do\n        (well, not exactly true, SWEC will ignore robots.txt).\n","versionString":"0.4","homepage":"https://random.zerodogg.org/swec/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,4]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["swec"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/networking/swec/default.nix:40","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["swec"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/networking/swec/default.nix:40","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
