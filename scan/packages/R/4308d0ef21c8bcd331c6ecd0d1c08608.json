{"frozen":{"name":"R","shortDescription":"Free software environment for statistical computing and graphics","longDescription":"GNU R is a language and environment for statistical computing and\ngraphics that provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and\nnonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series\nanalysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical\ntechniques, and is highly extensible. One of R's strengths is the\nease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be\nproduced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where\nneeded. R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data\nmanipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes an\neffective data handling and storage facility, a suite of operators\nfor calculations on arrays, in particular matrices, a large,\ncoherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data\nanalysis, graphical facilities for data analysis and display\neither on-screen or on hardcopy, and a well-developed, simple and\neffective programming language which includes conditionals, loops,\nuser-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n","versionString":"3.2.1","homepage":"http://www.r-project.org/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0+"},"versionNumberList":[3,2,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["R"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/math/R/default.nix:65","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
