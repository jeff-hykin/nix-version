{"frozen":{"name":"R","shortDescription":"a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics","longDescription":"GNU R is a language and environment for statistical computing and\ngraphics that provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and\nnonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series\nanalysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical\ntechniques, and is highly extensible. One of R's strengths is the\nease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be\nproduced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where\nneeded. R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data\nmanipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes an\neffective data handling and storage facility, a suite of operators\nfor calculations on arrays, in particular matrices, a large,\ncoherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data\nanalysis, graphical facilities for data analysis and display\neither on-screen or on hardcopy, and a well-developed, simple and\neffective programming language which includes conditionals, loops,\nuser-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n","versionString":"3.0.1","homepage":"http://www.r-project.org/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License version 2 or later","shortName":"GPLv2+","url":"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,0,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["R"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
