{"frozen":{"name":"R","shortDescription":"Free software environment for statistical computing and graphics","longDescription":"GNU R is a language and environment for statistical computing and\ngraphics that provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and\nnonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series\nanalysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical\ntechniques, and is highly extensible. One of R's strengths is the\nease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be\nproduced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where\nneeded. R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data\nmanipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes an\neffective data handling and storage facility, a suite of operators\nfor calculations on arrays, in particular matrices, a large,\ncoherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data\nanalysis, graphical facilities for data analysis and display\neither on-screen or on hardcopy, and a well-developed, simple and\neffective programming language which includes conditionals, loops,\nuser-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n","versionString":"4.0.0","homepage":"http://www.r-project.org/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[4,0,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["R"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/math/R/default.nix:91","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-windows","i686-windows","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","arm-none","armv6l-none","aarch64-none","avr-none","i686-none","x86_64-none","powerpc-none","msp430-none","riscv64-none","riscv32-none","vc4-none","js-ghcjs","aarch64-genode","x86_64-genode"]}}
