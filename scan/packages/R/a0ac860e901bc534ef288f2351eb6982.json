{"frozen":{"name":"R","shortDescription":"Free software environment for statistical computing and graphics","longDescription":"GNU R is a language and environment for statistical computing and\ngraphics that provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and\nnonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series\nanalysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical\ntechniques, and is highly extensible. One of R's strengths is the\nease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be\nproduced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where\nneeded. R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data\nmanipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes an\neffective data handling and storage facility, a suite of operators\nfor calculations on arrays, in particular matrices, a large,\ncoherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data\nanalysis, graphical facilities for data analysis and display\neither on-screen or on hardcopy, and a well-developed, simple and\neffective programming language which includes conditionals, loops,\nuser-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n","versionString":"4.1.1","homepage":"http://www.r-project.org/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[4,1,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["R"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/math/R/default.nix:98","date":"2021-10-20"}],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","aarch64-genode","i686-genode","x86_64-genode","x86_64-solaris","js-ghcjs","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","mmix-mmixware","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","aarch64-none","arm-none","armv6l-none","avr-none","i686-none","msp430-none","or1k-none","m68k-none","powerpc-none","riscv32-none","riscv64-none","s390-none","s390x-none","vc4-none","x86_64-none","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","x86_64-windows","i686-windows"]}}
