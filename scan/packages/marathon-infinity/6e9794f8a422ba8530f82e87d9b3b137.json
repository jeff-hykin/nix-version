{"frozen":{"name":"marathon-infinity","shortDescription":"Third chapter of the Marathon trilogy","longDescription":"Marathon Infinity takes the closed universe of the Marathon series and blows it wide open. The solo/co-op campaign, “Blood Tides of Lh’owon,” is a 20-level scenario sporting new textures, weapons, and aliens. More than that, the scenario sheds a surprising new light on the story’s characters and the meaning of events. Having defeated the Pfhor and reawakened the ancient remnants of the S’pht, the player now faces a world where friends become enemies and all is not what it seems…\n\nMarathon Infinity is the most popular Marathon game in online play, and is compatible with hundreds of community-made maps. This release includes the classic graphics, and revamped high-definition textures and weapons.\n","versionString":"20210408","homepage":"https://alephone.lhowon.org/games/infinity.html","versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["alephone-infinity"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/games/alephone/infinity/default.nix:16","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["alephone-infinity"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/games/alephone/infinity/default.nix:16","date":"2022-01-31"}]}}
