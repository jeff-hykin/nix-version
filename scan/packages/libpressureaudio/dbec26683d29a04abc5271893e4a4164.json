The problem with that is\nthat you still have to link against the original libpulse.\n\npressureaudio (http://git.r-36.net/pressureaudio/) wraps apulse\nwith everything you need to replace libpulse completely.\n\nThis derivation is a reimplementation of pressureaudio in pure\nnix.\n\nYou can simply override libpulse with this and most\npackages would just work.\n","versionString":"0.1.13","homepage":"https://github.com/i-rinat/apulse","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"MIT License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,1,13]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["libpressureaudio"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/misc/apulse/pressureaudio.nix:63","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["libpressureaudio"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/misc/apulse/pressureaudio.nix:63","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
