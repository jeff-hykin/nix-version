The problem with that is\nthat you still have to link against the original libpulse.\n\npressureaudio (http://git.r-36.net/pressureaudio/) wraps apulse\nwith everything you need to replace libpulse completely.\n\nThis derivation is a reimplementation of pressureaudio in pure\nnix.\n\nYou can simply override libpulse with this and most\npackages would just work.\n","versionString":"0.1.11.1","homepage":"https://github.com/i-rinat/apulse","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,1,11,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["libpressureaudio"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/misc/apulse/pressureaudio.nix:63","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
