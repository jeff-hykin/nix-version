It consists of a\nkernel driver and a daemon for collecting sample data, and\nseveral post-profiling tools for turning data into information.\n\nOProfile leverages the hardware performance counters of the CPU\nto enable profiling of a wide variety of interesting statistics,\nwhich can also be used for basic time-spent profiling. All code\nis profiled: hardware and software interrupt handlers, kernel\nmodules, the kernel, shared libraries, and applications.\n","versionString":"0.9.8","homepage":"http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/","license":"GPLv2","versionNumberList":[0,9,8]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["oprofile"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
