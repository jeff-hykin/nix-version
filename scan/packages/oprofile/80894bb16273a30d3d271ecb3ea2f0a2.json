{"frozen":{"name":"oprofile","shortDescription":"System-wide profiler for Linux","longDescription":"OProfile is a system-wide profiler for Linux systems, capable of\nprofiling all running code at low overhead.  It consists of a\nkernel driver and a daemon for collecting sample data, and\nseveral post-profiling tools for turning data into information.\n\nOProfile leverages the hardware performance counters of the CPU\nto enable profiling of a wide variety of interesting statistics,\nwhich can also be used for basic time-spent profiling. All code\nis profiled: hardware and software interrupt handlers, kernel\nmodules, the kernel, shared libraries, and applications.\n","versionString":"1.3.0","homepage":"http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,3,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["oprofile"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/profiling/oprofile/default.nix:35","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
