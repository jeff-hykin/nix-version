{"frozen":{"name":"oprofile","shortDescription":"System-wide profiler for Linux","longDescription":"OProfile is a system-wide profiler for Linux systems, capable of\nprofiling all running code at low overhead.  It consists of a\nkernel driver and a daemon for collecting sample data, and\nseveral post-profiling tools for turning data into information.\n\nOProfile leverages the hardware performance counters of the CPU\nto enable profiling of a wide variety of interesting statistics,\nwhich can also be used for basic time-spent profiling. All code\nis profiled: hardware and software interrupt handlers, kernel\nmodules, the kernel, shared libraries, and applications.\n","versionString":"1.0.0","homepage":"http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0"},"versionNumberList":[1,0,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["oprofile"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/profiling/oprofile/default.nix:24","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
