{"frozen":{"name":"oprofile","shortDescription":"System-wide profiler for Linux","longDescription":"OProfile is a system-wide profiler for Linux systems, capable of\nprofiling all running code at low overhead.  It consists of a\nkernel driver and a daemon for collecting sample data, and\nseveral post-profiling tools for turning data into information.\n\nOProfile leverages the hardware performance counters of the CPU\nto enable profiling of a wide variety of interesting statistics,\nwhich can also be used for basic time-spent profiling. All code\nis profiled: hardware and software interrupt handlers, kernel\nmodules, the kernel, shared libraries, and applications.\n","versionString":"1.3.0","homepage":"http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,3,0]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["oprofile"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/profiling/oprofile/default.nix:35","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
