{"frozen":{"name":"alloy","shortDescription":"Language & tool for relational models","longDescription":"Alloy is a language for describing structures and a tool for exploring\nthem. An Alloy model is a collection of constraints that describes a set\nof structures, e.g. all the possible security configurations of a web\napplication, or all the possible topologies of a switching network. The\nAlloy Analyzer is a solver that takes the constraints of a model and\nfinds structures that satisfy them. Structures are displayed graphically,\nand their appearance can be customized for the domain at hand.\n","versionString":"4.2_2015-02-22","homepage":"http://alloy.mit.edu/","license":{"fullName":"MIT License","shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT"},"versionNumberList":[4,2,"_2015-02-22"]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["alloy"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/alloy/default.nix:14","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
