{"frozen":{"name":"ndn-cxx","shortDescription":"A Named Data Neworking (NDN) or Content Centric Networking (CCN) abstraction","longDescription":"ndn-cxx is a C++ library, implementing Named Data Networking (NDN)\nprimitives that can be used to implement various NDN applications.\nNDN operates by addressing and delivering Content Objects directly\nby Name instead of merely addressing network end-points. In addition,\nthe NDN security model explicitly secures individual Content Objects\nrather than securing the connection or “pipe”. Named and secured\ncontent resides in distributed caches automatically populated on\ndemand or selectively pre-populated. When requested by name, NDN\ndelivers named content to the user from the nearest cache, thereby\ntraversing fewer network hops, eliminating redundant requests,\nand consuming less resources overall.\n","versionString":"0.1-4c32e7","homepage":"http://named-data.net/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 only","shortName":"lgpl3","spdxId":"LGPL-3.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0"},"versionNumberList":[0,1,"-4c32e7"]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["ndn-cxx"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/ndn-cxx/default.nix:30","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
