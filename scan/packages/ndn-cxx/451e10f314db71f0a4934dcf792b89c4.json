{"frozen":{"name":"ndn-cxx","shortDescription":"A Named Data Neworking (NDN) or Content Centric Networking (CCN) abstraction","longDescription":"ndn-cxx is a C++ library, implementing Named Data Networking (NDN)\nprimitives that can be used to implement various NDN applications.\nNDN operates by addressing and delivering Content Objects directly\nby Name instead of merely addressing network end-points. In addition,\nthe NDN security model explicitly secures individual Content Objects\nrather than securing the connection or “pipe”. Named and secured\ncontent resides in distributed caches automatically populated on\ndemand or selectively pre-populated. When requested by name, NDN\ndelivers named content to the user from the nearest cache, thereby\ntraversing fewer network hops, eliminating redundant requests,\nand consuming less resources overall.\n","versionString":"0.7.1","homepage":"https://named-data.net/","license":{"deprecated":true,"fullName":"GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0","spdxId":"LGPL-3.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,7,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["ndn-cxx"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/ndn-cxx/default.nix:36","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
