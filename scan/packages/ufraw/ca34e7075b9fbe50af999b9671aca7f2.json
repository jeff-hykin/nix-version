{"frozen":{"name":"ufraw","shortDescription":"Utility to read and manipulate raw images from digital cameras","longDescription":"The Unidentified Flying Raw (UFRaw) is a utility to read and\n        manipulate raw images from digital cameras.  It can be used on its\n        own or as a Gimp plug-in.  It reads raw images using Dave Coffin's\n        raw conversion utility - DCRaw.  UFRaw supports color management\n        workflow based on Little CMS, allowing the user to apply ICC color\n        profiles.  For Nikon users UFRaw has the advantage that it can read\n        the camera's tone curves.\n","versionString":"0.20","homepage":"http://ufraw.sourceforge.net/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0+"},"versionNumberList":[0,20]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["ufraw"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/graphics/ufraw/default.nix:21","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
