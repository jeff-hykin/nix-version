{"frozen":{"name":"undervolt","shortDescription":"A program for undervolting Intel CPUs on Linux","longDescription":"Undervolt is a program for undervolting Intel CPUs under Linux. It works in a similar\nmanner to the Windows program ThrottleStop (i.e, MSR 0x150). You can apply a fixed\nvoltage offset to one of 5 voltage planes, and override your systems temperature\ntarget (CPU will throttle when this temperature is reached).\n","versionString":"0.3.0","homepage":"https://github.com/georgewhewell/undervolt/","license":{"deprecated":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,3,0]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["undervolt"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/os-specific/linux/undervolt/default.nix:16","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["x86_64-linux"]}}
