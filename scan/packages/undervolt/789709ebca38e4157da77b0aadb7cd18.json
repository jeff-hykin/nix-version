It works in a similar\nmanner to the Windows program ThrottleStop (i.e, MSR 0x150). You can apply a fixed\nvoltage offset to one of 5 voltage planes, and override your systems temperature\ntarget (CPU will throttle when this temperature is reached).\n","versionString":"0.2.9","homepage":"https://github.com/georgewhewell/undervolt/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,2,9]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["undervolt"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/os-specific/linux/undervolt/default.nix:16","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":["x86_64-linux"]}}
