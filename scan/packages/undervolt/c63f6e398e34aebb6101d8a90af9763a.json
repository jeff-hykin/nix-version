It works in a similar\nmanner to the Windows program ThrottleStop (i.e, MSR 0x150). You can apply a fixed\nvoltage offset to one of 5 voltage planes, and override your systems temperature\ntarget (CPU will throttle when this temperature is reached).\n","versionString":"0.2.11","homepage":"https://github.com/georgewhewell/undervolt/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,2,11]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["undervolt"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/os-specific/linux/undervolt/default.nix:16","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["x86_64-linux"]}}
