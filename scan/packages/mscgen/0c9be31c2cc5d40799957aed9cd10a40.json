{"frozen":{"name":"mscgen","shortDescription":"Convert Message Sequence Chart descriptions into PNG, SVG, or EPS images","longDescription":"Mscgen is a small program that parses Message Sequence Chart\ndescriptions and produces PNG, SVG, EPS or server side image maps\n(ismaps) as the output. Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) are a way\nof representing entities and interactions over some time period\nand are often used in combination with SDL. MSCs are popular in\nTelecoms to specify how protocols operate although MSCs need not\nbe complicated to create or use. Mscgen aims to provide a simple\ntext language that is clear to create, edit and understand, which\ncan also be transformed into common image formats for display or\nprinting.\n","versionString":"0.20","homepage":"http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,20]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["mscgen"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/graphics/mscgen/default.nix:23","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
