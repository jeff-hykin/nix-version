{"frozen":{"name":"dwl","shortDescription":"Dynamic window manager for Wayland","longDescription":"dwl is a compact, hackable compositor for Wayland based on wlroots. It is\nintended to fill the same space in the Wayland world that dwm does in X11,\nprimarily in terms of philosophy, and secondarily in terms of\nfunctionality. Like dwm, dwl is:\n\n- Easy to understand, hack on, and extend with patches\n- One C source file (or a very small number) configurable via config.h\n- Limited to 2000 SLOC to promote hackability\n- Tied to as few external dependencies as possible\n","versionString":"0.1","homepage":"https://github.com/djpohly/dwl/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 only","shortName":"gpl3Only","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-only","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[0,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["dwl"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/window-managers/dwl/default.nix:61","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
