{"frozen":{"name":"mrbayes","shortDescription":"Bayesian Inference of Phylogeny","longDescription":"Bayesian inference of phylogeny is based upon a\nquantity called the posterior probability distribution of trees, which is\nthe probability of a tree conditioned on the observations. The conditioning\nis accomplished using Bayes's theorem. The posterior probability\ndistribution of trees is impossible to calculate analytically; instead,\nMrBayes uses a simulation technique called Markov chain Monte Carlo (or\nMCMC) to approximate the posterior probabilities of trees.\n","versionString":"3.1.2","homepage":"http://mrbayes.csit.fsu.edu/","license":"GPL2","versionNumberList":[3,1,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["mrbayes"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/biology/mrbayes/default.nix:15","date":"2019-03-01"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["mrbayes"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/biology/mrbayes/default.nix:15","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
