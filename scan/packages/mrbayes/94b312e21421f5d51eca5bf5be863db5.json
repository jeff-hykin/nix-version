{"frozen":{"name":"mrbayes","shortDescription":"Bayesian Inference of Phylogeny","longDescription":"Bayesian inference of phylogeny is based upon a\nquantity called the posterior probability distribution of trees, which is\nthe probability of a tree conditioned on the observations. The conditioning\nis accomplished using Bayes's theorem. The posterior probability\ndistribution of trees is impossible to calculate analytically; instead,\nMrBayes uses a simulation technique called Markov chain Monte Carlo (or\nMCMC) to approximate the posterior probabilities of trees.\n","versionString":"3.2.7a","homepage":"https://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,2,7,"a"]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["mrbayes"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/biology/mrbayes/default.nix:15","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["mrbayes"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/biology/mrbayes/default.nix:15","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
