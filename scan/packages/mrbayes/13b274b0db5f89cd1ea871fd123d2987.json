{"frozen":{"name":"mrbayes","shortDescription":"Bayesian Inference of Phylogeny","longDescription":"Bayesian inference of phylogeny is based upon a\nquantity called the posterior probability distribution of trees, which is\nthe probability of a tree conditioned on the observations. The conditioning\nis accomplished using Bayes's theorem. The posterior probability\ndistribution of trees is impossible to calculate analytically; instead,\nMrBayes uses a simulation technique called Markov chain Monte Carlo (or\nMCMC) to approximate the posterior probabilities of trees.\n","versionString":"3.1.2","homepage":"http://mrbayes.csit.fsu.edu/","license":{"deprecated":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,1,2]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["mrbayes"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/biology/mrbayes/default.nix:15","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
