{"frozen":{"name":"scheherazade-new","shortDescription":"A font designed in a similar style to traditional Naskh typefaces","longDescription":"\nScheherazade New, named after the heroine of\nthe classic Arabian Nights tale, is designed in a similar style to\ntraditional typefaces such as Monotype Naskh, extended to cover the\nUnicode Arabic repertoire through Unicode 13.0.\n\nScheherazade provides a “simplified” rendering of Arabic script, using\nbasic connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional\nligatures or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef\nligatures). This simplified style is often preferred for clarity,\nespecially in non-Arabic languages, but may not be considered appropriate\nin situations where a more elaborate style of calligraphy is preferred.\n\nThis package contains the regular and bold styles for the Scheherazade\nfont family, along with documentation.\n","versionString":"3.000","homepage":"https://software.sil.org/scheherazade/","license":{"fullName":"SIL Open Font License 1.1","shortName":"ofl","spdxId":"OFL-1.1","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/OFL-1.1.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,0]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["scheherazade-new"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/data/fonts/scheherazade/default.nix:27","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-windows","i686-windows","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","arm-none","armv6l-none","aarch64-none","avr-none","i686-none","x86_64-none","powerpc-none","msp430-none","riscv64-none","riscv32-none","vc4-none","or1k-none","mmix-mmixware","js-ghcjs","aarch64-genode","i686-genode","x86_64-genode"]}}
