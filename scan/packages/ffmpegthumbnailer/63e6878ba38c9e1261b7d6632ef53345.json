The thumbnailer uses ffmpeg o decode frames\n        from the video files, so supported videoformats depend on the\n        configuration flags of ffmpeg.\n        This thumbnailer was designed to be as fast and lightweight as possible.\n        The only dependencies are ffmpeg and libpng.\n    ","versionString":"2.0.10","homepage":"https://github.com/dirkvdb/ffmpegthumbnailer","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0"},"versionNumberList":[2,0,10]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["ffmpegthumbnailer"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/ffmpegthumbnailer/default.nix:17","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
