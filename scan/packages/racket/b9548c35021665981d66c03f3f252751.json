It goes beyond\nLisp and Scheme with dialects that support objects, types,\nlaziness, and more. Racket enables programmers to link\ncomponents written in different dialects, and it empowers\nprogrammers to create new, project-specific dialects. Racket's\nlibraries support applications from web servers and databases to\nGUIs and charts.\n","versionString":"6.2","homepage":"http://racket-lang.org/","license":{"fullName":"GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 only","shortName":"lgpl3","spdxId":"LGPL-3.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0"},"versionNumberList":[6,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["pltScheme"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/interpreters/racket/default.nix:66","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
