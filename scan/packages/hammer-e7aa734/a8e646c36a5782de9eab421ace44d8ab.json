Like many modern parsing libraries,\nit provides a parser combinator interface for writing grammars\nas inline domain-specific languages, but Hammer also provides a\nvariety of parsing backends. It's also bit-oriented rather than\ncharacter-oriented, making it ideal for parsing binary data such\nas images, network packets, audio, and executables.\n","versionString":"hammer-e7aa734","homepage":"https://github.com/UpstandingHackers/hammer","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["hammer"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/parsing/hammer/default.nix:18","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux"]}}
