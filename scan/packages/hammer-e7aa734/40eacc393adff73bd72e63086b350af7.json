Like many modern parsing libraries,\nit provides a parser combinator interface for writing grammars\nas inline domain-specific languages, but Hammer also provides a\nvariety of parsing backends. It's also bit-oriented rather than\ncharacter-oriented, making it ideal for parsing binary data such\nas images, network packets, audio, and executables.\n","versionString":"hammer-e7aa734","homepage":"https://github.com/UpstandingHackers/hammer","license":{"deprecated":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0","spdxId":"GPL-2.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["hammer"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/parsing/hammer/default.nix:17","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
