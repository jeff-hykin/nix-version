Like many modern parsing libraries,\nit provides a parser combinator interface for writing grammars\nas inline domain-specific languages, but Hammer also provides a\nvariety of parsing backends. It's also bit-oriented rather than\ncharacter-oriented, making it ideal for parsing binary data such\nas images, network packets, audio, and executables.\n","versionString":"hammer-e7aa734","homepage":"https://github.com/UpstandingHackers/hammer","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["hammer"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/parsing/hammer/default.nix:17","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{"kernel":{"_type":"kernel","execFormat":{"_type":"exec-format","name":"elf"},"families":{},"name":"linux"}}]}}
