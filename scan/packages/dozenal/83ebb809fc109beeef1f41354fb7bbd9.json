{"frozen":{"name":"dozenal","shortDescription":"A complete suite of dozenal (base twelve) programs","longDescription":"Programs\n\ndoz --- a converter; converts decimal numbers into dozenal. Accepts\n   input in standard or exponential notation (i.e., \"1492.2\" or \"1.4922e3\").\ndec --- a converter; converts dozenal numbers into decimal. Accepts input\n   in standard or exponential notation (i.e., \"X44;4\" or \"X;444e2\").\ndozword --- converts a dozenal number (integers only) into words,\n   according to the Pendlebury system.\ndozdc --- a full-featured scientific calculator which works in the\n   dozenal base. RPN command line.\ntgmconv --- a converter for all standard measurements; converts to and\n   from TGM, Imperial, customary, and SI metric.\ndozpret --- a pretty-printer for dozenal numbers; inserts spacing (or\n   other characters) as desired, and can also transform transdecimal digits\n   from 'X' to 'E' into any character or sequence of characters desired.\ndozdate --- a more-or-less drop-in replacement for GNU and BSD date, it\n   outputs the date and time in dozenal, as well as containing some TGM\n   extensions.\ndozstring --- a simple byte converter; absorbs a string either from\n   standard input or a command line argument, leaving it identical but\n   for the numbers, which it converts into dozenal. Options for padding\n   and for not converting specific numbers.\ndoman --- a converter which takes a dozenal integer and\n   emits its equivalent in a non-place-value system, such as\n   Roman numerals.  Arbitrary ranks and symbols may be used.\n   Defaults to dozenal Roman numerals.\n","versionString":"12010904","homepage":"https://github.com/dgoodmaniii/dozenal/","license":{"deprecated":true,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0","redistributable":true,"shortName":"gpl3","spdxId":"GPL-3.0","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0.html"},"versionNumberList":[]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9","attributePath":["dozenal"],"position":"/nix/store/wl7qj93w4x4z82izkg41gfxr2y2dw9n1-273bcc7a9a6bcf22781c7fb61df01ae8a7c68ec9.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/misc/dozenal/default.nix:28","date":"2021-10-20"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["dozenal"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/misc/dozenal/default.nix:36","date":"2022-01-31"}]}}
