{"frozen":{"name":"idutils","shortDescription":"GNU Idutils, a text searching utility","longDescription":"An \"ID database\" is a binary file containing a list of file\nnames, a list of tokens, and a sparse matrix indicating which\ntokens appear in which files.\n\nWith this database and some tools to query it, many\ntext-searching tasks become simpler and faster.  For example,\nyou can list all files that reference a particular `\\#include'\nfile throughout a huge source hierarchy, search for all the\nmemos containing references to a project, or automatically\ninvoke an editor on all files containing references to some\nfunction or variable.  Anyone with a large software project to\nmaintain, or a large set of text files to organize, can benefit\nfrom the ID utilities.\n\nAlthough the name `ID' is short for `identifier', the ID\nutilities handle more than just identifiers; they also treat\nother kinds of tokens, most notably numeric constants, and the\ncontents of certain character strings.\n","versionString":"4.6","homepage":"http://www.gnu.org/software/idutils/","license":"GPLv3+","versionNumberList":[4,6]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["idutils"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","powerpc-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
