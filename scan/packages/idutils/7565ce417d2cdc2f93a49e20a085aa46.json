{"frozen":{"name":"idutils","shortDescription":"Text searching utility","longDescription":"An \"ID database\" is a binary file containing a list of file\nnames, a list of tokens, and a sparse matrix indicating which\ntokens appear in which files.\n\nWith this database and some tools to query it, many\ntext-searching tasks become simpler and faster.  For example,\nyou can list all files that reference a particular `\\#include'\nfile throughout a huge source hierarchy, search for all the\nmemos containing references to a project, or automatically\ninvoke an editor on all files containing references to some\nfunction or variable.  Anyone with a large software project to\nmaintain, or a large set of text files to organize, can benefit\nfrom the ID utilities.\n\nAlthough the name `ID' is short for `identifier', the ID\nutilities handle more than just identifiers; they also treat\nother kinds of tokens, most notably numeric constants, and the\ncontents of certain character strings.\n","versionString":"4.6","homepage":"https://www.gnu.org/software/idutils/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[4,6]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":true,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["idutils"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/idutils/default.nix:25","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["idutils"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/misc/idutils/default.nix:25","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-windows","i686-windows","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","arm-none","armv6l-none","aarch64-none","avr-none","i686-none","x86_64-none","powerpc-none","msp430-none","riscv64-none","riscv32-none","vc4-none","or1k-none","mmix-mmixware","js-ghcjs","aarch64-genode","i686-genode","x86_64-genode"]}}
