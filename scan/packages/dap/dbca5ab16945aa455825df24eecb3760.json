{"frozen":{"name":"dap","shortDescription":"A small statistics and graphics package based on C","longDescription":"Dap is a small statistics and graphics package based on C. Version 3.0 and\nlater of Dap can read SBS programs (based on the utterly famous, industry\nstandard statistics system with similar initials - you know the one I\nmean)! The user wishing to perform basic statistical analyses is now freed\nfrom learning and using C syntax for straightforward tasks, while\nretaining access to the C-style graphics and statistics features provided\nby the original implementation. Dap provides core methods of data\nmanagement, analysis, and graphics that are commonly used in statistical\nconsulting practice (univariate statistics, correlations and regression,\nANOVA, categorical data analysis, logistic regression, and nonparametric\nanalyses).\n","versionString":"3.10","homepage":"https://www.gnu.org/software/dap","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,10]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["dap"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/science/math/dap/default.nix:19","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
