{"frozen":{"name":"ted","shortDescription":"Ted, an easy rich text processor","longDescription":"Ted is a text processor running under X Windows on Unix/Linux systems.\nTed was developed as a standard easy light weight word processor, having\nthe role of Wordpad on MS-Windows. Since then, Ted has evolved to a real\nword processor. It still has the same easy appearance and the same speed\nas the original. The possibility to type a letter, a note or a report\nwith a simple light weight program on a Unix/Linux machine is clearly\nmissing. Ted was made to make it possible to edit rich text documents on\nUnix/Linux in a wysiwyg way. RTF files from Ted are fully compatible with\nMS-Word. Additionally, Ted also is an RTF to PostScript and an RTF to\nAcrobat PDF converter.\n","versionString":"2.23","homepage":"https://nllgg.nl/Ted/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 only","shortName":"gpl2","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-only","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only.html"},"versionNumberList":[2,23]},"flexible":{"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb","attributePath":["ted"],"position":"/nix/store/z9pm444cj6kmm2m01vf28xa94bakm7cm-22091c912a38f2f9f8cb8efd612915a9346e57cb.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/typesetting/ted/default.nix:65","date":"2019-03-01"}],"platforms":[{}]}}
