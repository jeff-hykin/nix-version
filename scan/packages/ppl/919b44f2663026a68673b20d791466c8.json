{"frozen":{"name":"ppl","shortDescription":"The Parma Polyhedra Library","longDescription":"The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) provides numerical abstractions\nespecially targeted at applications in the field of analysis and\nverification of complex systems.  These abstractions include convex\npolyhedra, defined as the intersection of a finite number of (open or\nclosed) halfspaces, each described by a linear inequality (strict or\nnon-strict) with rational coefficients; some special classes of\npolyhedra shapes that offer interesting complexity/precision tradeoffs;\nand grids which represent regularly spaced points that satisfy a set of\nlinear congruence relations.  The library also supports finite\npowersets and products of (any kind of) polyhedra and grids and a mixed\ninteger linear programming problem solver using an exact-arithmetic\nversion of the simplex algorithm.\n","versionString":"1.2","homepage":"http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,2]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["ppl"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/ppl/default.nix:37","date":"2021-02-24"},{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["ppl"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/ppl/default.nix:37","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-redox","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
