{"frozen":{"name":"ppl","shortDescription":"The Parma Polyhedra Library","longDescription":"The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) provides numerical abstractions\nespecially targeted at applications in the field of analysis and\nverification of complex systems.  These abstractions include convex\npolyhedra, defined as the intersection of a finite number of (open or\nclosed) halfspaces, each described by a linear inequality (strict or\nnon-strict) with rational coefficients; some special classes of\npolyhedra shapes that offer interesting complexity/precision tradeoffs;\nand grids which represent regularly spaced points that satisfy a set of\nlinear congruence relations.  The library also supports finite\npowersets and products of (any kind of) polyhedra and grids and a mixed\ninteger linear programming problem solver using an exact-arithmetic\nversion of the simplex algorithm.\n","versionString":"1.1","homepage":"http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/","license":{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v3.0 or later","shortName":"gpl3Plus","spdxId":"GPL-3.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0+"},"versionNumberList":[1,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["ppl"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/development/libraries/ppl/default.nix:32","date":"2015-08-08"}]}}
