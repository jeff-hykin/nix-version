{"frozen":{"name":"ppl","shortDescription":"PPL: The Parma Polyhedra Library","longDescription":"The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) provides numerical abstractions\nespecially targeted at applications in the field of analysis and\nverification of complex systems.  These abstractions include convex\npolyhedra, defined as the intersection of a finite number of (open or\nclosed) halfspaces, each described by a linear inequality (strict or\nnon-strict) with rational coefficients; some special classes of\npolyhedra shapes that offer interesting complexity/precision tradeoffs;\nand grids which represent regularly spaced points that satisfy a set of\nlinear congruence relations.  The library also supports finite\npowersets and products of (any kind of) polyhedra and grids and a mixed\ninteger linear programming problem solver using an exact-arithmetic\nversion of the simplex algorithm.\n","versionString":"0.11.2","homepage":"http://www.cs.unipr.it/ppl/","license":"GPLv3+","versionNumberList":[0,11,2]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["ppl"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}]}}
