{"frozen":{"name":"xz","shortDescription":"XZ, general-purpose data compression software, successor of LZMA","longDescription":"XZ Utils is free general-purpose data compression software with high\n        compression ratio.  XZ Utils were written for POSIX-like systems,\n        but also work on some not-so-POSIX systems.  XZ Utils are the\n        successor to LZMA Utils.\n\n        The core of the XZ Utils compression code is based on LZMA SDK, but\n        it has been modified quite a lot to be suitable for XZ Utils.  The\n        primary compression algorithm is currently LZMA2, which is used\n        inside the .xz container format.  With typical files, XZ Utils\n        create 30 % smaller output than gzip and 15 % smaller output than\n        bzip2.\n","versionString":"5.2.1","homepage":"http://tukaani.org/xz/","license":[{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0+"},{"fullName":"GNU Library General Public License v2.1 or later","shortName":"lgpl21Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.1+","url":"http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1+"}],"versionNumberList":[5,2,1]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39","attributePath":["lzma"],"position":"/nix/store/f9gnvpp942xsz6y4wk5vyd5hrnmczz12-6542c344bcf0077e7530a0e8f02034aa92b52b39.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/compression/xz/default.nix:20","date":"2015-08-08"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
