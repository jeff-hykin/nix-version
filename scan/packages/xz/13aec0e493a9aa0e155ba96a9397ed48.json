{"frozen":{"name":"xz","shortDescription":"XZ, general-purpose data compression software, successor of LZMA","longDescription":"XZ Utils is free general-purpose data compression software with high\n        compression ratio.  XZ Utils were written for POSIX-like systems,\n        but also work on some not-so-POSIX systems.  XZ Utils are the\n        successor to LZMA Utils.\n\n        The core of the XZ Utils compression code is based on LZMA SDK, but\n        it has been modified quite a lot to be suitable for XZ Utils.  The\n        primary compression algorithm is currently LZMA2, which is used\n        inside the .xz container format.  With typical files, XZ Utils\n        create 30 % smaller output than gzip and 15 % smaller output than\n        bzip2.\n","versionString":"5.0.4","homepage":"http://tukaani.org/xz/","versionNumberList":[5,0,4]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"ad4156e4973abe0c306617c033169bc9c6fa44e1","attributePath":["lzma"],"position":null,"date":"2013-09-20"}],"platforms":["i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv7l-linux","mips64el-linux","x86_64-darwin","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","x86_64-freebsd","powerpc-freebsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd"]}}
