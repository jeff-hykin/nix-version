{"frozen":{"name":"xz","shortDescription":"XZ, general-purpose data compression software, successor of LZMA","longDescription":"XZ Utils is free general-purpose data compression software with high\n        compression ratio.  XZ Utils were written for POSIX-like systems,\n        but also work on some not-so-POSIX systems.  XZ Utils are the\n        successor to LZMA Utils.\n\n        The core of the XZ Utils compression code is based on LZMA SDK, but\n        it has been modified quite a lot to be suitable for XZ Utils.  The\n        primary compression algorithm is currently LZMA2, which is used\n        inside the .xz container format.  With typical files, XZ Utils\n        create 30 % smaller output than gzip and 15 % smaller output than\n        bzip2.\n","versionString":"5.2.5","homepage":"https://tukaani.org/xz/","license":[{"fullName":"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later","shortName":"gpl2Plus","spdxId":"GPL-2.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html"},{"fullName":"GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 or later","shortName":"lgpl21Plus","spdxId":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1-or-later.html"}],"versionNumberList":[5,2,5]},"flexible":{"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc","attributePath":["lzma"],"position":"/nix/store/7l0a51yav8p04d9l8dd5pmhds7pqvalf-05a7b69509f78b4ae9d04fcdf8f57ceb435572fc.tar.gz/pkgs/tools/compression/xz/default.nix:29","date":"2020-05-05"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-cygwin","i686-freebsd","i686-linux","i686-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-freebsd","x86_64-linux","x86_64-netbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-solaris","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","x86_64-windows","i686-windows","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","arm-none","armv6l-none","aarch64-none","avr-none","i686-none","x86_64-none","powerpc-none","msp430-none","riscv64-none","riscv32-none","vc4-none","js-ghcjs","aarch64-genode","x86_64-genode"]}}
