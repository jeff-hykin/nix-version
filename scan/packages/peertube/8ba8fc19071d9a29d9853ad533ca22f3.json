{"frozen":{"name":"peertube","shortDescription":"A free software to take back control of your videos","longDescription":"PeerTube aspires to be a decentralized and free/libre alternative to video\nbroadcasting services.\nPeerTube is not meant to become a huge platform that would centralize\nvideos from all around the world. Rather, it is a network of\ninter-connected small videos hosters.\nAnyone with a modicum of technical skills can host a PeerTube server, aka\nan instance. Each instance hosts its users and their videos. In this way,\nevery instance is created, moderated and maintained independently by\nvarious administrators.\nYou can still watch from your account videos hosted by other instances\nthough if the administrator of your instance had previously connected it\nwith other instances.\n","versionString":"3.4.1","homepage":"https://joinpeertube.org/","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later","redistributable":true,"shortName":"agpl3Plus","spdxId":"AGPL-3.0-or-later","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0-or-later.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,4,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["peertube"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/servers/peertube/default.nix:137","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["x86_64-linux"]}}
