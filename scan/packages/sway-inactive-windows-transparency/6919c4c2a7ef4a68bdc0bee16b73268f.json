{"frozen":{"name":"sway-inactive-windows-transparency","shortDescription":"It makes inactive sway windows transparent","longDescription":"Sway is a tiling Wayland compositor and a drop-in replacement for the i3\nwindow manager for X11. It works with your existing i3 configuration and\nsupports most of i3's features, plus a few extras.\nSway allows you to arrange your application windows logically, rather\nthan spatially. Windows are arranged into a grid by default which\nmaximizes the efficiency of your screen and can be quickly manipulated\nusing only the keyboard.\n","versionString":"1.7","homepage":"https://github.com/swaywm/sway/tree/1.7/contrib","license":{"deprecated":false,"free":true,"fullName":"MIT License","redistributable":true,"shortName":"mit","spdxId":"MIT","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"},"versionNumberList":[1,7]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc","attributePath":["sway-contrib","inactive-windows-transparency"],"position":"/nix/store/gqn35g78jqsq87nmdkx9vbhqk3mjd813-1097381d400990a3c9e4732a1a180e71ace9edcc.tar.gz/pkgs/applications/window-managers/sway/contrib.nix:90","date":"2022-01-31"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","m68k-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"]}}
