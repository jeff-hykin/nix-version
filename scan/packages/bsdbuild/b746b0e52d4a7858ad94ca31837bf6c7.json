{"frozen":{"name":"bsdbuild","shortDescription":"A cross-platform build system","longDescription":"BSDBuild is a cross-platform build system. Derived from the\ntraditional 4.4BSD make libraries, BSDBuild allows BSD-style\nMakefiles (without BSD make extensions), and works natively\nunder most operating systems and make flavors. Since BSDBuild\nis implemented as a library (as opposed to a macro package),\nMakefiles are edited directly, as opposed to being compiled\n(however, if the build directory is separate from the source\ndirectory, BSDBuild will produce the required Makefiles in place).\n","versionString":"3.1","homepage":"http://bsdbuild.hypertriton.com","license":{"fullName":"BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","shortName":"bsd3","spdxId":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html"},"versionNumberList":[3,1]},"flexible":{"unfree":false,"insecure":false,"broken":false,"sources":[{"git":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git","commit":"6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3","attributePath":["bsdbuild"],"position":"/nix/store/hqc8hlzsl1qyzdyam91kvj1ww22yw538-6c36c4ca061f0c85eed3c96c0b3ecc7901f57bb3.tar.gz/pkgs/development/tools/misc/bsdbuild/default.nix:52","date":"2021-02-24"}],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","mipsel-linux","i686-linux","x86_64-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux"]}}
